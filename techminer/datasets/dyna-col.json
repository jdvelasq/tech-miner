    "Abstract": "This research evaluates the effect of osmotic dehydration (OD) as a pretreatment of convective drying in mango pieces (Tommy Atkins) using whole cane sugar solutions in concentrations between 30 and 65 \u00b0Brix, and temperatures between 50 and 80 \u00b0C in a central composite rotatable design. The effect on effective diffusivity, water loss, sugar gain, color index (CIE-L*a*b*), water activity, sensory perception (color, texture and flavor), and consumption probability were measured. Effective diffusivity was influenced only by temperature of solution, presenting a maximum of 1.4E-4 cm2s-1. Water loss in OD registered a maximum of 40%. Color perception was affected by both variables. The consumption probability was influenced by the conditions evaluated with a maximum value of 80%. It was found the optimal conditions of OD in 65\u00b0Brix and 79 \u00b0C. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Friction Stir Welding (FSW) has the advantage of generating sound welds on materials that generally present low weldability by traditional fusion welding processes, such as 2xxx and 7xxx aluminum alloys. Force measurement in FSW provides significant information about the process, the machine requirements, the effect of selected parameters, and weld soundness. In this paper, an axial force measuring device was designed, built, and tested to be used in a CNC adapted system. All tests were performed using AA 7075-T6 and a butt joint configuration. The forces obtained by the device match, in profile, key values, and trends, the ones found in literature which allows to conclude that this is a functional and sufficient device for the application. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Every day, roads are submitted to greater stresses. Thereby, additives have been incorporated to asphalt mixtures to enhance pavements performance. The purpose of this experimental study is to characterize for the first time, to date, the viscoelastic properties of asphalt samples modified with recycled rubber -from used vehicles tires- and asphaltite in the same mixture, at different temperatures and frequencies. All with the aim of optimizing the material properties and coming up with a proposal to an environmental issue: discarded vehicles tires and their after-service use. The stiffness of briquettes was analyzed by axial compression test. The results were principally represented in Black Space and Cole-Cole plot and indicate a substantial increase in stiffness and elasticity of the modified asphalt throughout the whole temperature range. This shows that the simultaneous addition of these two ingredients to the bitumen is a favorable alternative in road construction using asphalt pavements. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, sugar cane bagasse has applications as an alternative fuel in most of the sugar cane industries. However, other residues like sugar cane straw particles (SCSP), produced by mechanized harvesting, may be interesting for several applications, as a fuel or as a non-conventional aggregate for cement composite production, in this case partially replacing mineral aggregates. In this research, the behavior of a composite utilizing SCSP (replacing 33% of the sand, by volume) combined with four types of inorganic matrices was evaluated, one of them based on ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and three alternative matrices containing pozzolans by OPC replacement, such as ground fly ashes (GFA) and spent fluid catalytic catalyst for petrol (FCC) (A:100%OPC; B:50%OPC+50%GFA); C:50%OPC+40%GFA+10%FCC and D:50%OPC+30%GFA+20%FCC). Composite performance was evaluated daily by non-destructive ultrasonic test (NDT) and, after 28 days, by flexure and compression tests. Results showed the influence of the composite age on ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), finding a stabilization on UPV values at 28 days; and also the great influence of the matrix type on composite mechanical performance. Flexural and compressive strengths of composites with matrix A showed superiority when compared to the alternative matrices. Among them, matrix D showed superiority. In a general way, 33% (by volume) sand replacement by SCSP sharply decreased the composit\u00e9s mechanical performance: bending strength (a reduction of 9% to 24%) and compressive strength (a reduction of 38% to 53%). For matrices containing pozzolans, the decrease in mechanical performance was significantly lower.",

A stochastic approach is employed to build the conceptual model, a stochastic Equivalent Porous Medium fractured rock facies model, for the low-permeability bedrock found at Olkiluoto (Finland), which is the site chosen for the case-study. The volume of rock investigated is located around a cluster of boreholes and it covers an area of 160000 square meters. Field measurements during hydraulic interference tests are used to calibrate the groundwater flow model. Multiple stochastic facies realizations are considered to evaluate the impact of distribution and number of facies on simulated hydraulic heads and flow rates. This study quantifies the variability of numerical results, which is important for uncertainty analysis of hydrogeologic systems. Moreover, it shows that the stochastic facies conceptual model is a suitable alternative to discrete fracture network conceptual models.",

    "Abstract": "The main goal of condition-based maintenance is to describe the machine state under current operating regimes, which can be non-stationary depending of load/speed changes. Besides, damaged machine data are not always available in real-world applications. This paper proposes a methodology of outlier detection in time-varying mechanical systems based on dynamic features and data description classifiers. Dynamic features set is formed by spectral sub-band centroids and linear frequency cepstral coefficients extracted from time-frequency representations. One-class classification is carried out to validate performance of the dynamic features as descriptors of machine behavior. The methodology is tested with a data set coming from a test-rig including different machine states with variable speed conditions. The proposed approach is validated on real recordings acquired from a ship driveline. The results outperform other time-frequency features in terms of classification performance. The methodology is robust to minimal changes in the machine state and/or time-varying operational conditions.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, the mechanical properties of butt joints of AA1100 Aluminum alloy obtained through FSW in a conventional milling machine and a friction stir welding machine were compared. The joints were obtained using the same tool geometry and welding parameters. The milling machine was adapted to ensure position control during the welding process and the friction stir welding machine was operated under force and position control modes. Mechanical properties of the beads were evaluated through tensile tests and microhardness measurements. Defects generated in the joints were analyzed using optical and scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that mechanical properties were strongly affected by the welding parameters, whereas the kind of machine influenced the presence of defects in the joints. It was found that the tensile properties were more appropriate to compare the results between sets of parameters and level of defects than the hardness test. Higher mechanical properties and a lower level of defects were obtained in the FSW machine by position control mode, with tensile strength around 130MPa, whereas the highest tensile strength obtained in the conventional milling machine was 109 MPa.",

    "Abstract": "A review of advantages and thermodynamic limitations present in the sorption isosteric method (SIM) showed that SIM does not guarantee a constant adsorbed amount. Isosteres computed considering ideal gas behavior show that in SIM the mass of gas in the system dead volume increases as equilibrium pressure increases due to desorbed materials. SIM is useful and effective in obtaining highly accurate thermodynamic data for sorption of gases by microporous and nanoporous materials at low temperatures and pressures.At high temperatures and pressures desorption is not negligible, therefore SIM can not be applied. The errors in the calculation of the isosteric heat using SIM can be reduced using traditional experimental procedures such as adsorption isobars and isotherms to generate isosteres at high temperatures and pressures. Alternatively, corrections by pressure and temperature or an experiment that, after each temperature increase, allows gas dosage to compensate for the amount of mass desorbed would guarantee a constant adsorbed amount and, therefore, isosteric behavior by direct measurements.",

In addition, we consider the recommendations of preprocessing by eliminating the trend and seasonal cycle using simple and seasonal differentiation. Finally, we use forecast combining for determining if there is complementary information between the forecasts of the individual models. Our numerical evidence supports the following conclusions: ES models have a better fit but lower predictive power than the RBFNN; detrending and deseasonality allows the RBFNN to fit and forecast with more accuracy than the RBFNN trained with the original dataset; there is no evidence of information complementarity in the forecasts such that the methodology of forecasts combination is not able to predict with more accuracy than the RBFNN and ES methodologies.",

    "Abstract": "The bender element (BE) test is used in laboratory to obtain the shear wave velocity of soils. Different execution and interpretation techniques have been proposed. However, there is not a specialized technique with an adequate level of accuracy and reproducibility to be adopted as a standard. Several factors affect the reliability of this method, mainly because of complex phenomena of wave propagation in the small volume of the specimen. Three type of soils were tested by Resonant-Column (RC) and two BE test methods (BETD and BEFD). Results suggest that in non-plastic soils the stiffness tends to be underestimated compared with the stiffness obtained by the RC test. The BETD method could be affected by the soil plasticity. The frequency domain method (BEFD) had less agreement with respect to the RC test.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this research was to evaluate the performance of an Upflow Immobilized Biomass Anaerobic Reactor (UIBAR) treating real hospital wastewater. The organic matter removal and the toxicity were assessed through COD, UV254nm and the measure of the growth inhibition of onion roots (Allium cepa L). The results show that the biological process was stable during the 287 days of continuous operation; the mean value of the IA/PA relation was 1.21\u00b10.08, indicating that there was no acid accumulation in the system. However, the efficiency of reduction of COD, 56\u00b115% and UV254nm, 21\u00b136%, is not quite representative. The toxicity was reduced in by 50%. Therefore, it is necessary to continue with the removal of organic matter to combine the anaerobic process with other processes such as an advanced oxidation process. The capacity of the anaerobic immobilized process to remove the compounds that produce toxicity was verified.",

    "Abstract": "Lightning parameters such as ground flash density GFD have been determined using mainly deterministic methods and in the last 20 years the main source of information has been lightning location systems (LLS) data. GFD has some problems like the dependence on the area of the grid studied, strong variations between data in closer points of the grid and its low descriptive capability. Additionally LLS introduce other problems due to the location accuracy that must be in accordance with the area of the grid to be studied. This paper presents a novel fuzzy parameter to calculate ground flash density using modern computational techniques. The new parameter called Fuzzy Ground Flash Density (FGFD) can deal with the problems related to the GFD parameter itself and the location accuracy of the LLS. FGFD gives a better representation of the phenomena and it is more adequate for practical problems especially in engineering subjects such as lightning location systems design and lightning risk assessment. Some examples were created to demonstrate the validity of the new parameter and a real case using the Colombian LLS data is shown.",

    "Abstract": "The northeastern of Santiago de Cali contains abundant terrigenous sands deposits. These sands are with low fine content, in a loose state, and with high water table levels, due to its proximity to the banks of the Cauca River. These characteristics, and the high seismicity of the city, make the liquefaction phenomenon an imminent risk in the area. This paper presents the results of an experimental study carried out to evaluate the liquefaction resistance of Aguablanca terrigenous sands in Santiago de Cali. The experimental program included mineralogical characterization, index properties, and undrained cyclic triaxial tests on isotropically consolidated reconstituted samples. A comparison with researches conducted on others silica sands and one calcareous sand is performed. Results showed a very low liquefaction resistance of the Aguablanca sand in comparison with the other sands, when were tested under similar conditions.",

    "Abstract": "To develop a product with market success need the means to control how it communicates messages to its user. This article introduces a methodology for product concepts generation, based on the adaptation of the work with systems of layouts from graphic design. Links user perceptions to several aspects of the product, so it is related to other methods like Kansei Engineering (KE). If KE mainly analyses aesthetics, using mathematic methods, working with layouts develops sets of conceptual options, relating aesthetics and technical aspects of the product (the publication), from an appraisal of its communicative potential as most relevant feature. Its adaptation to product design could be useful since it's more oriented to concept generation rather than to information analysis; also, its application is easier than KE, though less precise. Proposed methodology has been applied to the conceptual innovative design of aesthetic and technical general features of an Harley-Davidson-type ecological motorcycle.",

    "Abstract": "Molybdenum is an attractive metal for the steels and cast iron production because it promotes a strong hardening, increasing the mechanical strength when the alloy is subjected to controlled cooling in a critical temperature range. This has caused a considerable increase in demand for molybdenum products, which comes from molybdenite concentrates (MoS2) as secondary products of porphyry copper deposits. In this paper we present results of a molybdenite concentrate low grade, with slightly different compositions, which reflect differences in the operating results of roasting. These differences are due in large part to the reaction mechanisms identified as impurities in the concentrate as Fe Tests are made to determine the optimal conditions for recovery of Mo and the rate constants determined for each sample.",

    "Abstract": "Agroindustrial wastes are a major environmental problem worldwide. Due to high quality requirements, commercialization of export lemons generates huge amounts of wastes. Lemon wastes have fiber, pectin, potassium, calcium and vitamin C. Therefore, it is important to develop alternative processing methods to add value and improve their shelf life. The aim of this work was to apply infrared drying, as an emergent technology, to study the effect of drying temperature on the drying kinetics of lemon waste at 30, 40 and 50\u00b0C. Six thin layer models found in literature were used to represent the experimental drying kinetics. Based on statistical tests, the Logarithmic model presented the best fit. Values of moisture effective diffusivities were in the range of 9.45\u00d7 10-10-3.71\u00d7 10-9 m/s2. The value of activation energy was 55.90 kJ/mol.",

A double screw extruder was used, set at 130\u00b0 C in the barrel and a rotational speed of the screws programmed at 200 RPM. The moisture content of the bran was adjusted at 20%. The treated bran was stored, using two packing methods (with and without vacuum), at two ambient conditions (18\u00b0 C - 70 % RH and 30\u00b0 C - 78% RH) for a period of 8 weeks. The content of free fatty acids (FFA) in the rice bran was observed during the storage time period. The extruded treated rice bran stored at 18\u00b0 C - 70% RH resulted in lower values of FFA in comparison with the values in the bran kept at 30\u00b0 C - 78% RH. Vacuum packaging showed a significant disadvantage as compared to packaging without vacuum. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

In the research, the economic and financial information of 483 certified and uncertified arquitecture firms containing the economic and financial database SABI has been analysed. Having analysed the homogeneity of the sample and refined data, we have found that companies certified with these standards have been significantly more profitable. Nevertheless, the results of the research show that the performance differences before certification are higher than after certification. Then, the better performance of certified firms may be due to a selection effect: firms with better performance have a higher tendency to achieve UNE 150301 and ISO 14006 certification.",

    "Abstract": "Alchemy arises as a science in the Alexandrian Museum, along with other exact sciences, in the early centuries of the Christian era. Its origins are found in the Egyptian work on materials and in the ideas derived from Greek philosophers of Golden Age thought. Results of exact sciences work are shown, in order to give an idea of what alchemy was at its beginnings. Over the time, alchemy was polluted with religious thoughts, transforming its language to a dark one. Its main goals were to take advantage of spirits (vapors) contained in substances forming the elixirs to reach the metallic transmutation, and to find the Philosopher's Stone (The Elixir), which would serve for the transmutation of base metals into gold and to get an eternal and healthy life. The work of the early alchemists, their equipment, and the elixirs and alloys they used, are described. The possible chemical reactions -representing breaking and formation of bonds due to chemical affinity- that could explain the changes observed by them, are presented. Some alchemists looked unsuccessfully the theory that could sustain alchemical practice. However, practical alchemy became practical chemistry, laying the foundations of many industries and those of theoretical chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Hydrocyclone is a device commonly used in mineral processing industry. Many studies attempt to understand size separation phenomenon but, none of them has taken an energy point of view. This paper presents the results of modeling underflow energy dissipation in hydrocyclone operation from a mechanical energy balance. The results related to newtonian suspensions show that underflow energy dissipation does not control the operation. That magnitude is small compared to interior energy dissipation but provides enough information to describe underflow conditions. The most important dimensionless parameters to this study about hydrocyclone energy modeling are exit diameters ratio, split ratio, normalized air core diameter and discharge angle.",

To ensure and accelerate the convergence of this algorithm, the Anderson mixing scheme technique is employed, giving both strength and efficiency to methodology. To validate the proposed methodology a colombian distribution system is used, in order to make a comparative analysis over different scenarios respect to traditional studies, which consider solidly grounded systems. The results obtained show that the grounding systems must not be neglected in the power flow analysis because the technical losses index can be wrong, and these losses have impact on losses reduction plans and electricity tariff structure, among others.",

    "Abstract": "Acrylic bone cements with a solid/liquid 2/1 ratio were formulated. Methyl methacrylate (MMA) was the liquid monomer and 2.5% dimethyl-p-toluidine was the accelerator. The solid component included poly(methylmethacrylate) as load, PMMA, Barium sulfate as radio opaque agent, and 2% benzoyl peroxide as initiator. Finally, hydroxyapatite as bioactive load, and dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate (DMAEM) as alkaline co-monomer, were incorporated into the material in different percentages (0-20% w/w for the first one and 0-10% for the latter). As expected, the samples prepared from the above formulations presented high reaction temperatures (>80\u00b0C) and high resistance to compression (124.0 MPa) above those specified by ISO 5833 standard. An increase in the percent of hydroxiapatite and alkaline co-monomer lead to low polymerization temperatures, low modules and low mechanical resistance, as well as a deposition of a dense layer similar to biological apatite on the surface of the material after being dipped in a simulated biological fluid for 30 days.",

Some correlations are established between these two parameters and the expected behavior for a clean water body at a given atmospheric temperature and pressure. The analysis was based on data obtained in the Phase II of the \"Red R\u00edo\" project that was developed by a group of universities for the local environmental authority to study the river. After an extensive analysis of multiple OD and T data that was taken at 20 sampling stations, this review presents a water environmental quality index easy to calculate, based on the differences between the T and OD experimental curves and their expected behavior for an uncontaminated stream. The results show, in a very clear and didactic way, how the river behaves across the 20 sampling stations. We propose the use of this index as a practical tool to maintain a continuous monitoring of the environmental performance of this river or other watercourses.",

In this, the effect of biocatalysis time and type of drying (forced convection and vacuum drying) on the morphological, structural and pasting properties of enzymatically modified cassava starch granules was evaluated. The application of amyloglucosidase generated a degree of hydrolysis ranging between 35.87 and 41.02% dextrose equivalents (ED), in addition, it caused significant changes in starch granules morphology. At structural level, modified starch reveals substantial changes with respect to control, where FT-IR spectra show the displacement of absorption bands by tension or bending in the region between 900 and 1100 cm-1 due to the breakdown of \u03b1-D-glucosidic bonds \u03b1-D-(1,4) or \u03b1-D-(1,6), increasing swelling, absorption and solubility in water properties. Likewise, significant changes are reported in pasting properties together with an increase in stability in techno-functional properties of hydrolyzed starches dried by vacuum. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The concept of chemical affinity emerges in early historical periods. It develops from creative thinking, freeing itself from the beliefs of the time and institutions of power, nurturing the exchange of ideas, absorbing knowledge from Egypt and Babylon. Greek thought -represented by a group of Ionians and Athenians centered on Aristotle, plants the germ of chemical affinity with the concepts of atom, element and substance and with the notion of attraction and repulsion between elements, which is the precursor to the concept of \"affinity\". This concept, focused on knowledge, thought and common sense following Aristotle, was the basis of Western thought. Experimentation, the act of responding to situations and needs as they were presented, and practice, ran alongside each other since the Bronze Age, but were independent of the development of Greek thought. In this way, ancient people became familiar with metal alloying and other procedures and substances that are directly involved in obtaining or that are byproducts of processes and reactions owing to chemical affinity.",

This is to identify treatment alternatives to reduce their impact and its contamination potential. In the characterization of stillage were determined important parameters for the quality of them, such as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), suspended solids, nitrates, ammonia, phosphates, etc. It was found that the stillage have a lower pollutant load when it is compared to other stillage from a process with a different raw material. However, they have high BOD5 and COD values, as well as, nitrates, phosphates and total solids which exceed the Colombian law for effluent discharges.",

    "Abstract": "Fast and accurate bacterial colony identification is a common requirement in many fields, and usually is supported by the use microscopic, biochemical and molecular tools. But procedures involving these tools might be expensive or time consuming. This study uses image analysis of laser diffraction patterns, obtained from intact bacterial colonies in order to asses its suitability to differentiate bacterial colonies. We also tested the effect of the colony incubation period on these patterns, and the role of the volume of culture media on the laser light diffraction patterns. Laser diffraction patterns were obtained from the five bacterial isolates B1, B2, B3, B2Ca y B2Cb. Bacterial colony differentiation by its diffraction patterns was assessed using isolates B2, B3, B2Ca. The role of colony incubation period on obtained diffraction patterns was tested by using isolates B1 and B2Cb, whereas agar plates without colonies were used to assess the role of different volumes of culture media on its laser diffraction patterns. It was found that the volume of culture media may reduce the quality of the laser diffraction patterns. A multivariate dimensional analysis on laser diffraction patterns also indicated that these can be used to differentiate the bacterial colonies included in the test. Finally, the length of the incubation period on the differences among diffraction patterns of the same isolate appears to be negligible. It is concluded that this simple technique could be used to support the design of sensible equipments based mainly on cheap, locally available supplies, which in turn might support industry and research needs requiring fast and accurate bacterial colony detection.",

    "Abstract": "Since the Song Dynasty in the Middle East, around the twelfth century, the windmills have been protagonists in transforming wind energy to certain mechanical work such as water extraction or milling. Consequently, throughout history this kind of industrial heritage has been researched from various points of view, but not always from the point of view of engineering. After making an inventory of the 89 windmills, the followed methodology have been getting their 3D model, characterizing the wind and finishing with the mechanical study of their main functioning parameters. The result has been on the one hand, their suitability to work at low speeds producing high torque thanks to the exposed surface of the sails to the wind, and on the other hand, windmills of Cadiz and Huelva have a higher wind performance thanks to be better designed than those of Almer\u00eda.",

    "Abstract": "The use of different supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) in the production of self-compacting concretes (SCCs) is an increasingly common practice. In this paper, results of a research about the use of residue of masonry (RM) as SCM are presented. Frattini test, resistance activity index and thermogravimetry testing were carried out. The influence of RM on the fresh and hardened properties of the SCC was studied by replacing the Portland cement in percentages of 0 to 50% by volume. The fresh properties of the SCCs were measured by slump flow test, L-box and V-funnel. The test results showed that the RM has pozzolanic activity and can be used as SCM. The SCC manufactured with RM presented good performance in terms of self-compactability; however, the RM, because of its low reactivity at early ages, showed a decrease in the compressive strength, that was directly proportional to the percentage of replacement. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Modern footbridges are susceptible to vibration related problems due to the development of new materials with greater strength and the subsequent longer spans of these bridges. Unfortunately Colombian building codes are very limited when it comes to the design and retrofit of these structures. In this paper a classification is provided of the footbridges that exist in Santiago de Cali, and human-structure interaction effects, maximum accelerations and natural frequencies are compared with vibration design criteria specified by different building codes. Although measured accelerations in the 19 bridges considered in this study did not exceed the maximum values specified in the building codes for a person walking across the bridge, 16 of these bridges had vibration levels that caused discomfort in the pedestrians. Hence, it is recommended that future Colombian codes establish ranges of accelerations and natural frequencies in function of performance criteria that account for perceived comfort and safety.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents an iterative strategy to adjust the system load which is applied for locating faults in power distribution systems. The strategy estimates the system load using the measurements of voltages and currents at the substation; therefore this proposal considers all of the variations at pre-fault and fault time instants. Also, the strategy uses a refinement process to estimate the system load using an iterative algorithm which considers the distance to the fault calculated in the previous iterations. Then, the fault location is determined by the estimation of the distance from the substation to the fault point which is calculated using short circuit analysis in function of the phase parameters of distribution system. Finally, this strategy is validated in the IEEE 34 test feeder, which is composed for single-phase, two-phase and three-phase feeders and considering several fault resistances from 0\u03a9 to 40\u03a9. According to the obtained results, the error presented is less than 1%.",

    "Abstract": "We investigated the seasonal evolution of the thermal structure of La Fe Reservoir based on field data and weather variables collected in 2010 and 2011 and the application of the hydrodynamic model ELCOM. The reservoir receives contributions from natural sources and water through a pumping system during the dry periods. We found that there is not a relevant influence of the annual cycle in the atmosphere-lake heat fluxes, although there were measurements during El Ni\u00f1o, transition, and La Ni\u00f1a. The observed changes in the thermal structure are mainly due to the hydrological conditions of the inflows and the operation of the pumping system. It was found that the northern basin is dominated by the dynamics of the natural inflows and water withdrawal, while in the south basin dynamics is dominated by the imported water.",

The solution obtained is analogous to a recurrence relation and its explicit solution to first order is obtained via an iterative or perturbative approach. Finally, using our results we observed significant changes in the magnitude spectrum when there is variation in flexural rigidity under ideal loads.",

The ash was 100 mesh-sieved and added to the mix in 5, 10, 15 and 20% of the cement bulk. Physical analysis unveiled that EWA has a specific gravity higher than other organic originated residues, whereas its BET specific surface area is not enough to enhance its filler and/or pozzolanic effects. Chemically, the residue presented a low organic matter rate and a SAI below the minimum required by the Brazilian standards. EWA interfered in the times of cement set, increasing them, while FTIR unveiled mainly the presence of calcium carbonate bonds. The admixture compromised the concretes mechanical performance, leading to the conclusion that the sieving procedure of EWA alone is not enough do admit its usage as a mineral admixture. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The present research is aimed at analyzing the current outsourcing situation in European companies and, particularly, in the Spanish ones, and at establishing the bases to be able to understand the foreseen transition to more developed practices such as the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO). The current macroeconomic frame, especially adverse in the case of Spain, makes this kind of methodologies have a warm welcome among companies, either public or private ones, since they are seen as having important chances to save money. The aim is definitely to take some measures to cut not only general costs in the usual outsourcing field, but also operation and core processes costs, following mostly the modern BPO. Moreover, a new economic activity is generated around BPO, which can be interesting for the Spanish strategic consultancy firms. Some aspects like economies of scale and the consequent obtaining of minor costs or the know-how of the companies which provide this kind of services that could even produce an increase in the chapter of incomes based on economies of scope make that BPO clients think at least of the possibility of including them in some of their processes and sub-processes. Finally, this research makes a brief observation about the relation between BPO and the so-called Offshoring, by which growing companies or simply those eager to enhance their income statement accounts, can relocate their productive processes by means of costs.",

    "Abstract": "This research evaluates the effects of the inoculum size and enzymatic activity on the concentration of ethanol obtained through the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of alkali-pretreated cassava stems. Other goals for this study include the determination and validation of the optimal conditions for and the evaluation of the process of ethanol production in a bioreactor. Alkaline-pretreated cassava stems were used as the substrate in a solid to liquid ratio of 1:10; the enzymatic complex Accellerase 1500 and the yeast Ethanol Red were evaluated at two levels at a temperature of 38\u00b0 C and a pH of 4.0 in an Erlenmeyer flask. The following were evaluated as process controls: simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of non-pretreated stems and separate saccharification and fermentation of pretreated stems. A regression analysis was conducted, and the resulting model was maximized using genetic algorithms. At the optimal conditions identified in an Erlenmeyer flask, the production of ethanol in a 5-liter bioreactor was subsequently evaluated. An experimental concentration of ethanol of 1.88\u00b10.04% v/v (1.99% v/v simulated optimum) was obtained using an inoculum concentration of 1.59 g/L and an enzyme concentration of 13.3 FPU/g. This value was approximately four times the quantity of ethanol produced without pretreatment or by the separate saccharification and fermentation of pretreated cassava stems. The evaluation of the process in the bioreactor yielded an ethanol concentration 20% less than that reached in the Erlenmeyer flask.",

Members of this heterogenic group are called hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria. However, an unestimated number of hydrocarbonoclastic marine bacteria have not yet been characterized. In this context, a microcosm study was carried out, simulating a marine environment contaminated with oil in Upstream Flow Bioreactors (UFB). Eleven bacterial isolates were characterized from these microcosms. The taxonomic position of the bacteria identified was determined by partial sequencing of the gene 16S rRNA in 4 major genera: Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Halomonas and Haererehalobacter. This research demonstrated the presence of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria recognized in consortia and provides additional information about Haererehalobater a new genera of hydrocarbonoclastic marine bacteria. The outlook for better understanding of the diversity of hydrocarbonoclastic marine bacteria and potential uses in bioremediation and other biotechnological processes is discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Sintering is a process by which a mixture of iron ores, fluxes and coke is agglomerated in a sinter plant to manufacture a sinter product of a suitable composition, quality and granulometry to be used as burden material in the blast furnace. This process is studied and researched in the steelmaking industry in general, and in sinter plants in particular, as well as in universities and metallurgical research centres throughout the world. As a result of this research, and the experience accumulated over many years, the sintering process is well understood. Nevertheless, despite this good knowledge of sintering, there are still a number of issues that need to be studied. The present work provides information on the iron ores that form part of the mineral mix which, once granulated, is loaded onto the sinter strand where it is partially melted at a temperature of between 1250-1350 \u00b0C and undergoes a series of reactions that give rise to the formation of sinter; a material of a suitable composition and strength to be loaded into the blast furnace to produce pig iron.",

We used a set of 3000 curves whose control points were randomly generated. Smooth curves were obtained after seven steps of subdivision using five schemes DFDS, Four-Point (4P), New four-point (N4P), Tight four-point (T4P) and the geometrically controlled scheme (GC4P). The tortuosity property was evaluated on every smooth curve. An analysis for the frequency distributions of this property using the Kruskal-Wallis test reveals that DFDS scheme has the lowest values in a close range.",

    "Abstract": "At present it is estimated that 85% of the population has access to an adequate service of drinking water; but about 40% is not registered or billed, for leakage or clandestine outlets, which is a problem in the management and distribution of water for human consumption. A way to determine the efficiency of the system based on the values of the leakage flows, having as main indicator the infrastructure leakage index (ILI), which allows to measure the effectiveness of maintenance activities of red. In developed countries this index is considered, with an average pressure value during the 24 hours of the day; but the reality of the developing countries is another, so in this paper the two alternatives for the correction of the ILI are presented, based on statistical data on the unaccounted-for water of an Ecuadorian population. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This study suggests the equimolar mixture of Natural Gas (100% CH4) and Synthesis Gas (40% H2 + 40% CO + 20% CO2) as an alternative to reduce hydrocarbons consumption and reduce pollutant emissions. As a key parameter to characterize this combustible mixture, the laminar burning velocity was studied based on numerical simulations and experimental measurements in flames generated using a contoured slot-type nozzle burner and the Schlieren technique, varying the air-fuel ratio at standard temperature and pressure. It was found that the flame speed of the equimolar mixture increases with respect to that of pure methane. This behavior can be explained by the presence of hydrogen in the fuel mixture, which has a direct effect on the combustion kinetics, generating H and OH radicals that increase the global reaction rate of the mixture and consequently the burning velocity.",

    "Abstract": "The KAOS (Knowledge Acquisition autOmated Specification) goal diagram can be used to hierarchically represent and analyze organizational goals. In the context of the UNC-Method, such goals are often written in the aforementioned diagram by using a set of verbs denoting achievement, in order to represent the organizational goals and requirements. Nowadays, the importance of the goals is only established by the diagram hierarchy. However, requirements engineering considers other elements as well as the hierarchy in such a matter. On the other hand, there are proposals that assign importance to the goals on other diagrams, but they neglect the hierarchy and the type of verb that is used in wording. These reasons lead us to propose in this paper, a method for allocating weighted salience to KAOS diagram goals, in the context of the UNC-Method. We consider the verb type and the hierarchy. We explain this proposal by means of a lab study.",

    "Abstract": "The industrial practice used to produce furfural is the dehydration of pentoses, which is carried out using highly corrosive and contaminating mineral acid catalysts. Because of the ecological and toxicological threats of this process and the complexity of product separation associated with these substances, the development of new acid solid catalysts has expanded in recent years. The present work is focused on the production of furfural from D-xylose using aluminum and hafnium pillared clays as catalysts. After 4 h of reaction at temperatures ranging between 140 and 170\u00b0C, conversion rates of 50-80% were observed, and selectivity levels of 40-65% were reached. Finally, the stability of the catalyst was further investigated by applying a thermal treatment prior to reuse. A significant decrease in the selectivity was not observed in four consecutive reactions. Consequently the pillared clays appear to be active, selective and stable catalyst for pentose dehydration.",

    "Abstract": "Experimental measurements of laminar flame speed for premixed methane-air flames were carried out for different equivalence ratios at subatmospheric conditions, 852 mbar and 298 K. The flames were obtained using a rectangular port burner with a water cooler system necessary to maintain the temperature of the mixture constant. An ICCD camera was used to capture chemiluminescence emitted by OH-CH radicals present in the flame and thus define the flame front. Laminar flame speed was calculated using the cone method and experimental results were compared with those reported by other authors and the numerical simulations made with the software CHEMKIN using the GRIMECH 3.0 mechanism. In this work it was found that decreasing the barometric pressure from 1013 mbar to 852 mbar generated an increase of 7% in the laminar flame speed.",

This work presents the design and implementation of a flexible testbed system, including the solution to some synchronization problems. We also present a distributed software architecture that defines the control flow, the subsystem decomposition, and the mapping to hardware of the testbed. A running example of the testbed for a binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) system is developed to illustrate the results attained by the proposed testbed in terms of the performance comparison between the testbed measurements, and the theoretical and simulated ones with a loss of 2 dB.",

The fermentations were done using Saccharomyces cerevisiae under anaerobic conditions, 32\u00b0C, and pH 4.6. For each fermentation substrate the effect of the nitrogen source on cell viability (V), substrate conversion (CS), ethanol yield (Yp/s), and productivity was evaluated. The MGSF substrate showed the highest product yield (5.86 gg-1) and substrate conversion (47.58%) at 18 and 24 h of fermentation, respectively, with a maximum ethanol concentration of 60 gL-1. Substrate MMAN showed a low ethanol yield (36 gL-1). It was concluded that guava seed flour is a viable and economic nitrogen source for alcoholic fermentations.",

    "Abstract": "Electric power distribution companies are facing a challenging moment in time. Privatizations, scarce resources, low investments, and harsh penalties owing to inadequate quality force these companies to seek greater efficiency and control of their processes. Thus, decision-making based only on tacit knowledge and without a clear procedure, as was done by the maintenance company considered in this study, is not advisable. Accordingly, this work aimed to develop a support tool for maintenance decisions based on failure data and criticality analysis. The Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method was used to discover the riskiest failure modes, and the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) and Mudge method were used to rank the main criteria used by experts when deciding which transmission line (TL) is in a more critical condition. As a result, the study proposed a tool that guides decision-making in a systematic, impersonal, and collective knowledge-based manner for the specific situations encountered in TL maintenance. The results were approved and judged satisfactory by the members of a team of specialists from the maintenance area. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Also, calculation of the recirculation factor obtained through numerical simulation for different configurations of confined jets taken from literature which do not involve chemical reactions, when compared with the recirculation confined jet theories of Craya-Curtet, Thring-Newby and Magnussen show that as recirculation increases, all the theories overpredict the recirculation factor.",

    "Abstract": "By means of a three-dimensional laser system, archeological remains resultant of excavations in a castro of Galicia were scanned, being obtained in the first place different loose parts of the external surface of every piece. Next, methods were applied to generate the integral surface of each piece from the different loose parts or patches. As main objective, it was developed and implemented two methods for virtual reconstruction of incomplete archaeological remains. These methods are based on the integration of traditional methods of archaeological drawing with CAD (Computer Aided Design). Moreover, from the superficial model of each piece, methods were studied for the generation of a complete solid model of each one, thus being able to keep internal information (material, density, etc.) of the objects, with the possibility of making cuts of all type.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents the definition and the extended application of a fault location technique for power distribution systems based on the well defined equivalent sequence networks. The proposed location technique uses single end measurements of voltage and current and considers variable load, through a proportional factor applied to the measured currents. The analysis is presented for three types of shunt faults, single phase to ground faults, phase to phase faults and three phase faults. The localization technique is tested on the 34 bus IEEE test feeder of 24.9kV; it includes three-phase and single phase laterals, for all types of faults in two different load scenarios and considering fault resistances between 0\u03a9 and 40\u03a9. The estimation errors obtained in fault distance lower than 2.5%.",

    "Abstract": "Several authors have established how important it is for companies to have accurate product cost information, especially in the actual environment of intense global competition. However, it has been shown that traditional systems do not satisfy these business demands, so in recent years new cost methods have been proposed, nevertheless these are still inaccurate. It is because of this situation that this paper presents a new methodology for determining the storage cost of a product that can be extrapolated to all the links of the supply chain. In turn, we propose a new cost driver, the logistics index, which helps to provide more precise information than traditional methods. It concludes by showing a business case where this model is implemented in a Spanish logistics company.",

As a consequence, methodologies that allow the estimation of climate change condition should be studied, taking into account a non- stationary approach as the one used in this study, in which stationary and non-stationary IDF curves were estimated for 9 pluviographic stations located in the Medellin river basin. To adjust the precipitation time series, the distribution of extreme values EV1 was used; its stationary parameters were calculated by means of the L-moments method and the non-stationary ones by the mobile windows. The effect of climate change on high intensities and small durations have been evidenced, obtaining that the stationary approach can underestimate extreme events up to 39%. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

There are cases where occur temporal change on the relationship presented above while the force is applied, cases where a make a description of the photoelasticity phenomenon is more difficult by the complexity of it, the deformation of plastic films is one of these cases. This paper presents a technique based in similarity metrics for the image analysis on photoelasticity studies of plastic film deformation under mechanical stress. The plastic film is deformed in a mechanical traction machine, the photoelasticity images are captured in a video camera through of optical assembly. The dynamic behavior of the mechanical deformation in the plastic film can be related whit dynamics behavior obtained in the similarity metrics.",

To realise the ferrite synthesis of Pb, Cd and Mn in relation Fe2+/M2+ 15:1 being varied conditions of the air flow and using nitrates of Pb, Cd and Mn and chlorides of Cd and Mn, has been the objective of this work. The secured stoichiometries were the same (Pb0.04Fe2.96O4, Cd0.06Fe2.94O4, Mn0.12Fe2.88O4) not finding dependency of the anion to begin with. On ferrites it bases ion nitrate, was a tendency of diminution of Fe2+, with the increase of the air flow. For those of synthesized cadmium and manganese from chloride, a greater diminution of Fe2+ than in the obtained ones from nitrates was observed; probably due to the presence of Cl- that in the middle basic happens to ClO- and these they give rise to the potential oxidation Fe2+ to Fe3+ catalyzed by the own ions participant Fe2+, Fe3+ and Mn2+ in the synthesis. For the cadmium ferrite smaller contents of Fe2+ to the found ones in cadmium ferrites were determined from nitrates; possibly all the Fe2+ by smaller chloride concentration did not oxidize (0.018M) that in the one of manganese (0.036M) and only incidence the catalytic ion effect Fe2+ and Fe3+.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a two-dimensional distributed model for the transport and reaction of combustion gases in channels of three-way catalytic converters, considering a detailed reaction kinetics with 16 chemical reactions in palladium and rhodium catalysts, and taking into account diffusive effects within the coating, to obtain a new set of reaction kinetic parameters that do not depend on the thickness of the coating. The model was solved using a finite volume method with a first order upwind scheme and simulations were conducted using computational fluid dynamics. The model proposed with the new distributed reaction kinetic parameters, produced an excellent agreement with the experimental data of concentration at the end of the channels. Also, the model reproduced the most important concentration changes for the gas components in the specified temperature range and allowed simulations with excess oxygen and different thicknesses. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, an exergoeconomic analysis is performed on a vapor compression refrigeration system using R134a. A productive structure is proposed and the exergetic and exergoeconomic costs balances are implemented with and without considering the components allocation costs of the residue formation process. A parametric analysis is carried out to evaluate the behavior of the exergetic and exergoeconomic operation costs, the coefficient of performance and the exergetic efficiency depending on the change in the ambient temperature, the refrigeration temperature, the adiabatic efficiency and the refrigeration capacity. The results show the system product costs (cooling effect) considering the residue costs is 56.8 % greater than the product cost obtained by discarding them. The parametric analysis shows that the exergetic and exergoeconomic operation costs are mainly affected by the change in the ambient temperature followed by the change in the refrigeration temperature. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In regions of tropical and subtropical climates, nearly all installations used for intensive broiler chicken production and other animals of economic interest operate as curtain-sided open structures with assisted mechanical ventilation. The lack of ventilation control in these facilities, along with wind direction and velocity effects on ventilation uniformity, complicates calculation of the quantity of gases (ammonia and others) generated by the litter at a given moment. This fact constitutes a pitfall when evaluating the polluting potential of open environments, and when comparisons with data encountered in closed environment facilities used in temperate climates need to be done. All developed countries of Europe and North America already possess methodologies to determine gas emissions in closed installations commonly found in these regions. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate some specific methodologies used for determining ammonia emissions from broiler houses located in countries of Europe and the United States, and verify the possibility for application of these methodologies to open structures commonly found in Brazil and other countries of South America. A quantitative evaluation showed that the methods with best characteristics for adaptability to the operational conditions and the different types of conditioned environments of buildings with positive pressure or natural ventilation systems were the internal tracer gas, the portable monitoring unit (PMU) and the mobile air emissions monitoring unit (MAEMU). According to the results, model-based approaches that use mass balance and passive diffusion samplers such as the \"Ferm Tube\" and the Saraz Method for Determination of Ammonia Emissions (SMDAE) proposed by Osorio (2010), can also be adapted to different operational conditions for open buildings.",

    "Abstract": "Falling film reactors (FFR) are widely used in industry, mainly in those processes which require an efficient heat exchange. Although, these devices have been studied for several years, there is not yet a full understanding of their behavior. This is due to the fact that the performance of the FFRs can be easily influenced by hydrodynamic factors which affect transport phenomena in the reactor. In this study, an experimental analysis of hydrodynamic factors influencing a FFR is presented, paying special attention to hydrodynamic phenomena such as the phases' flow regimens and the residence time for the sulphonation of methyl ester (ME) from palm oil with SO3. The results show that along with the SO3/ME ratio the hydrodynamic of both phases (gas and liquid) present in the reactor have a strong influence over the sulphonation efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Friction and wear coefficient represent two important variables for hard coating selection in critical engineering applications such as cutting and material forming. To explain fully these variables, is necessary to understand different types of wear mechanisms that occur in coated surfaces. Zirconium nitride (ZrN), chromium nitride (CrN) and titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN) coatings produced by reactive magnetron sputtering technique were evaluated. The tribological properties- coefficient of friction (COF) and wear coefficient were investigated using a ball on disc tribometer and profilometry. Bias polarization voltage showed an increase in plastic deformation and third body generation failures in the ZrN surface. Nitrogen flux increasing in CrN deposition, improves tribological behavior due to cubic phase segregation, enhancing superficial properties. Increasing substrate temperature during deposition of TiAlN improves superficial properties (roughness and porous density decrease), increases abrasion wear resistance and load capability of the coating.",

Blends with PANICX contents ranging from 1 to 50 wt% were first prepared using a two-piece batch mixer, followed by ram-extrusion to obtain cord-like extrudates. The microstructure was analyzed by SEM, and conductivity was evaluated with a Keithley electrometer. The blends' rheological behavior was also studied. Evidence of formation of well-defined elongated structures was found in most of the extrudates. The extrudates' conductivity was considerably low. Inhomogeneity-related problems were observed such as erratic behavior of pressure, \"melt-fracture\" during the extrusion, and extrudates with irregular microstructure and very low conductivity. This occurred because same size batches were used regardless of blends' composition. As a result, the shearing occurring during compounding was not enough to disperse PANICX effectively within the SBS matrix.",

In this paper, we present an approach for classification of brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) images from healthy and diseased subjects. The approach builds up a saliency map, which extract regions of relative change in three different dimensions: intensity, orientation and edges. The obtained regions of interest are used as suitable patterns for subject classification using support vector machines. The strategy's performance was assessed on a set of 198 MR images extracted from the OASIS database and divided into four groups, reporting an average accuracy rate of 74.54% and an average Equal Error Rate of 0.725%.",

    "Abstract": "We adapt the universal kriging method of prediction to contexts with uncertainty and imprecise data. Using fuzzy set theory, we develop a fuzzy universal kriging that we use to estimate quality classes for a quartz deposit. The method models the trend in the data by linearly combining functions that depend on the coordinates for each point, which are fuzzy numbers. The spatial dependence between the data is determined by means of non-fuzzy covariograms. The proposed method provides fuzzy numbers and non-fuzzy variances at unsampled locations. Finally, the estimated fuzzy numbers are translated back into quartz qualities and graphically represented. From the grade model obtained by using fuzzy kriging it has been possible to perform selective mining at the deposit depending on market demand of the four products exploited.",

    "Abstract": "This article shows the main results after roasting a gold ore with electromagnetic waves. A mineral sample from southern Bolivar (Colombia) was chosen, due, among other reasons, to the difficulty that miners from that zone tend to have when trying to recover the gold by traditional means. It was found that after applying electromagnetic waves in the microwaves range, roasting time was reduced by 77 to 83%, on average decreasing the consumption of electrical energy by about 88%, while allowing gold recoveries of about 90% (w/w) of that achieved through traditional roasting. This indicates that it is an alternate treatment worth deeper exploration at pilot plant scale.",

We have grown [TiCN/TiNbCN] n multilayered via reactive RF (radio frequency) magnetron sputtering technique in which systematically the bilayer period (\u039b) and the bilayer number (n were varied), maintaining the total thickness of the coatings constant (~ 3 \u03bcm). The multilayers were evaluated and compared for corrosion, erosion and erosion-corrosion at an impact angle of 90\u00b0 in a solution of 0.5 M NaCl and silica which simulates a marine environment, analyzing the effect of the number of bilayers on the corrosion resistance of these coatings. Polarization curves were conducted at rest potential. After the polarization experiments the specimens were analysed by scanning electron microscopy. The results show good performance of the multilayer systems in dynamic corrosion systems and erosion-corrosion, furthermore the enhancement of wear is due to the fact that the polarizations curves move towards areas where current densities decrease by increasing the bilayer number.",

    "Abstract": "The efficiency of an anaerobic-aerobic biofilm passive system for nitrogen conversion was investigated. Leachate from real landfill is characterized by high ammonia content. Several techniques have been tested for ammonia nitrogen removal including air stripping, which imply high cost operation. In this work, an innovative design which combines a Bio- Reactive Permeable Barrier (BioBarrier) and multilayer Bio-trickling Reactor (BtR) was evaluated for nitrogen removal. The results show an excellent performance of BtR system, in which concentration of NO3 raise from 100\u00b110 mg/L NO3 to near 1000\u00b1100 mg/L NO3. Almost 95% NH4 removal was observed, demonstrating efficiency of this device. However, N dynamics in BRPB had no important changes, probably due to low biofilm content of the package material. The BtR system was designed to promote O2 transference from the atmosphere without external energy input. Results confirm feasibility of nitrification process within tower. From the experimental data it can be concluded that BtR system is an efficient and economical system for ammonia removal, making it an innovative and potential system for small communities.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents an integral solution of the overvoltage problem caused by mismatched conditions when DC-DC converter outputs of PV systems are connected in series, and a distributed maximum power point tracking architecture is implemented. The operating conditions that cause the overvoltage problem are discussed in detail and the consequences of the overvoltage problem are illustrated. The proposed solution is based on a structure that includes a non-linear controller, two linear controllers, and a maximum power point tracking algorithm. Such a solution makes it possible to regulate the PV voltage according to the MPPT controller commands and to limit the DC-DC converter output voltage to avoid damages. The non-linear control structure is experimentally validated with a boost converter and a BP585 PV panel. Simulation results show that the proposed integral solution allows the operation of PV panels in the feasible maximum power point and protects the integrity of the DC-DC converters, avoiding the overvoltage problem caused by mismatched conditions.",

The sediments occur by the organic and inorganic matter precipitation from leachates dumped in retention lagoons, which can present toxic characteristics than affect the environment. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential toxicity of leachates from a municipal landfill, using the TCLP procedure and acute toxicity assays with Daphnia pulex and Poecilia reticulata as biological indicators. The results showed that the sediment evaluated, did not exceed the stablished levels suggested by the EPA for the TCLP test, nor were they toxic to the organisms used. This results, suggests a potential agricultural use of this material in acid soils, since the nature of leachate sediments are pH alkaline and rich in nutrients and organic matter. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "During the last years, geomatic techniques have been crecently applied to many aspects related to construction engineering field. The application of geomatics in this field arises from the necessity of using real and accurate geometry in several phases of the construction process, as well as due to the advantages of using remote and non-destructive methods, that allows, among others, to reduce risks during measurement processes for as-built structures, reducing costs during surveys, and most importantly, reducing costs through automation. The TF1-Close Range Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry Group- is a research team at the University of Vigo (Spain) that has developed and tested several terrestrial geomatic techniques in different fields related to construction engineering. After applying these techniques for a decade, it has been demonstrated that such geomatic methods have significantly benefit the procedures for documentation, inspection works, and also, successfully solved some of the limitations of registration of certain parameters that are essential for the stability of structures. This paper presents a compilation of works where terrestrial photogrammetry, laser scanning, ground penetrating radar and infrared thermography are applied to situations or activities related to the processes of construction.",

    "Abstract": "Electrokinetic phenomena controls and drives many interactions in soft matter physics. In biology, for example, many of living functions are derived from complicated electrokinetic phenomena that interrelates cells, solvents, ions, solutes and tissues. This paper defines, explores and provides a novel method towards the analysis and understanding of such problems. The new method is a generalization of the General Geometry Ewald-like Method (GGEM); it combines continuum and statistical mechanics through a Green's function formalism for the long-range interactions. In this way, the separation of time and length scales, commonly encountered in soft matter fluids, is avoided. The fundamental equations behind electrokinetic problems are exposed and the paper finishes with a description of the novel Nernst-Planck-GGEM approach.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, the effect of photocatalytic (PC) pretreatment of potato starch with TiO2 during the gelatinization (GE) stage of a simultaneous saccharification-fermentation (SSF) process for bioethanol production was evaluated. The maximum amounts of reducing sugars were 119.3, 114.6 and 104.8 g l-1 for PC \u2192 GE, GE\u2192PC and the reference (without PC), respectively, while bioethanol concentration gradually increased to a maximum amount of 128.21, 106.74 and 85.91 g l-1 after 30 h for PC\u2192GE, GE\u2192PC and the reference (without PC), respectively. Although enzymatic activity (vmax) for each treatment was similar, in the reference (without PC pretreatment) it did not promote rapid substrate conversion into ethanol, despite showing the higher affinity enzyme-substrate (Km). Considering traditional potato starch hydrolysis, PC pretreatment shortened the reaction time of the biological reactions. Thus, the PC pretreatment of potato starch for bioethanol production could be an environmentally feasible process without the addition of acid and alkali. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The first two approaches are those by Engesser and Haringx that include the shear component of the applied axial force proportional to the total slope (dy/dx) and to the angle of rotation of the cross section (\u03a8) along the member, respectively. The third approach is a simplified formulation based on the classical Euler theory that includes the effects of shear deformations but neglects the shear component of the applied axial force along the member. Definite criterion on minimum stiffness of lateral bracings for single-stepped columns is also presented. Five comprehensive examples are included that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stability equations and minimum bracing stiffness criteria.",

Discharges were carried out applying a voltage of 104 V between the electrodes. Materials used as cathodes were Ti, Zr, Ni, Cu, Mo, and W. The cathodes' morphology after the discharge production was studied using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. Ti and Zr presented the highest erosion. Moreover, circular craters on Ni and Mo cathodes were observed and a region of the Zr cathode, with high erosion and a high quantity of craters was analyzed. The discharge voltage for each material was measured, obtaining arc voltage values. Finally, relationships between arc voltages and some material characteristics such as the melting point and the boiling point were observed, presenting an exponential tendency.",

Two of its main advantages are independence from initial pre-alignment and spatial transformation, obtaining a more accurate registration regardless of the initial viewing position.",

    "Abstract": "Shaking tables are experimental tools to assess the behavior of structures and nonstructural components under characteristic seismic vibrations. Because of the size and weight limitations of the tables, testing reduced-scale models or testing only the main structural components are normally necessary. In these cases, to comply with modeling requirements, large amount of extra-mass should be added to the specimen. This paper reviews and discusses the mass-rig systems for shaking table testing. The advantages and drawbacks of each system are critically compared. To avoid the risk of lateral instability of models and to maintain the weight of test specimens within table payload, external devices for transmitting the inertial forces to the models have become a preferred choice when tests are performed using small- or medium-size shaking tables.",

    "Abstract": "The determination of the complex reflection coefficient of ultrasonic shear-waves at the solid-liquid interface is a technique employed for the measurement of the viscoelastic properties of liquids. An interesting property of the measurement technique is the very small penetration depth of the shear-waves into the liquid sample, which permits measurements with liquid films of some micrometers thick. This property, along with the adhesion of oily substances to surfaces, can be used for the detection of oily contaminants in water. In this work, the employment of the ultrasonic shear-wave reflection technique to the detection of oily contaminants in water is proposed and the theoretical and experimental concepts involved are discussed. Preliminary experimental results show the measurement technique can detect SAE 40 automotive oil in water in volume proportions less than 0.5%.",

    "Abstract": "Knowing the 3-D behavior of friction coefficient (\u03bc) vs. traveling speed (v) and wheel slip ratio (s) on runway and highway pavements can facilitate the modern pavement engineers' job to a great extent. However, current methodology is limited to measuring \u03bc at desired v and predicting it at different s values (at the same measured v) using 2-dimensional models. The paper presents a study carried out with friction data collected using Locked Wheel Skid Trailer (LWST) (ASTM E 274 Standard Test Method), to obtain the 3-D behavior of \u03bc vs. v and s. An available 3-D friction model which is a combination of two well known 2-D friction models; Pennsylvania State University (PSU) model and Rado model, was used with LWST data collected in a field test on a wet asphalt pavement. The findings suggest that this method can provide reasonable predictions of \u03bc for pavement management purposes.",

    "Abstract": "The main objective was to obtain kinetic and thermodynamic equilibrium of asphaltene sorption onto powdered rock obtained from the Guadalupe formation (washed and unwashed) at different times, temperatures and concentrations. However, the effect of temperature in the equilibrium sorption was not significant. Rock powders were characterized by N2 sorption at -196\u00b0C. Equilibrium sorption of asphaltenes in rock powders, within a range of concentrations from 250 to 1500 ppm, was determined using a static method. Sorption curves show Type I behavior, according to IUPAC. The Langmuir model was used for computing the monolayer asphaltene content values for the sorption at different temperatures, showing a good fit with respect to the experimental data. Sorption kinetics of asphaltenes in rock samples is a function of the concentration and for concentrations of 1500 ppm equilibrium is reached at about 90 min. Pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to the experimental data for the different concentrations for the two rock samples, with a better result for the pseudo-first order kinetic model. The washing effect on the equilibrium was not significant; however the adsorptive capacity of the rock without washing was slightly higher than the rock washed with n-heptane and toluene.",

At the present, it is almost impossible to develop software applications without them. One of the most desired features of CASE tools is its automated source code generation. Nowadays, several CASE and metaCASE tools attempted to do such generation, but they share two main problems: they use, as a starting point, technical languages which are not suitable for stakeholder validation, and they generate an incomplete and non-patterned source code. This is why in this paper we propose a CASE tool for automatically generating a PHP source code under the model view controller (MVC) programming pattern. We use pre-conceptual schemas as a starting point. We aim to generate a complete source code and to ease stakeholder validation.",

There are global maps that estimate the area affected by a fire using the reflectance variation of the surface. In this study, we evaluated the reliability and the causes of error of the MCD45 Burned Area Product, by applying the confusion matrix method to the Orinoco River Basin. This basin is located in the northern zone of South America, and consists mainly of savanna ecosystems. For the evaluation, we used as reference data five pairs of Landsat images, covering 165,000 km2. The Burned Area Product estimated a burned area of 7,576.43 km2, which is lower than the area of 12,100.16 km2 found with Landsat images, leading to an overall underestimation. The causes of error are associated to the spatial resolution of the map, and to some structures of the algorithm that generates the map.",

The method considers a physiologically based linear model that takes both spatial and temporal dynamics into account and a weighting stage to modify the assumptions of the model from observations. The calculated weighting matrix is included in the cost function used to solve the dynamic inverse problem, and therefore in the Kalman filter formulation. In this way, a weighted Kalman filtering approach is proposed including a preponderance matrix. The filter's performance (in terms of localization error) is analyzed for several SNRs. The optimal performance is achieved using the linear model with a weighting matrix computed by an inner product method.",

    "Abstract": "The relationship between fiber geometry and the damage sequence under tensile loading has been investigated for a composite material reinforced with different textiles architectures such as mat (random fibers) and woven (biaxial). These composites are based on epoxy resin matrix cured with high temperature hardener. The system chosen for this work consists of a bifunctional epoxy, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA), cured with a tetrafunctional amine, diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS). This system ensures the obtaining of a rigid transparent material with excellent mechanical properties in order to observe, analyze and identify the process and progress of the generated damage and the failure mechanism which leads to the materials fracture. Results demonstrated that the reinforcement textile architecture/geometry affects the generation of stress concentration sites augmenting the possibility of failure initiation and cracks propagation.",

    "Abstract": "In this work we present an optical Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) strain sensor appropriate for uniaxial compression test of rocks. The rocks are a complex aggregate of materials and may exhibit in some cases mineral grains of size bigger than the conventional electrical strain gages used. Furthermore, commercial surface mountable optical FBG strain sensors are packaged in planar configuration, which is not appropriate for the cylindrical rock cores in uniaxial compression test. The optical FBG sensors were designed and manufactured manually fitted for cylindrical rock samples. A calibration process was carried out in order to stablish the mechanical performance of the FBG packaging; later, a compression test was conducted on hard rock sample and the strain was recorded by the traditional electrical strain gage (ESG) and FBG system. Under this comparison, the FBG sensors reaches a larger recording area, sensitivity under 100 microstrain and a reliable strain transfer, all of which is appropriate to measure strain for heterogeneous rock composition and minerals grain size. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

For this, the broilers facilities should be designed in such a way that affords the best conditions of thermal comfort in both winter and summer. Thus, mathematical modeling has been an interesting tool in the definition and understanding of projects of thermal analysis for environment compatible with industrial aviculture in Brazil, making the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to be highly recommended. The aim of this work was to elaborate the state of art of the applicability of CFD in environment of broilers facilities and their current limitations. It starts from the assumption that from CFD models it is possible to acquire knowledge of the distributions of velocity, air temperature, gases and particulate matter, when facilities are subjected to natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation and adiabatic evaporative cooling systems.",

    "Abstract": "A probabilistic formulation for evaluating loss exceedance rates associated to earthquake is presented. First, the usefulness of such models is exposed; later, it is presented the mathematical formulation of a Poissonian model which considers the uncertainty in variables such as: the earthquake magnitude, the ground motion intensity at basement rock, the ground motion intensity at surface level and the damage at the buildings. The results are summarized by the annual exceedance rates for a given level of loss. It could be obtained for only one building, for a group of buildings or for the whole set of affected buildings. At last, for an assumed portfolio where are considered different combinations of types of buildings, types of soils and geographic location, the loss exceedance rates are calculated. The results show how estimated losses could be strongly influenced for the location and the kind of the structural system of the buildings.",

The sequence with hard HSM milling resulted in a reduction of 55% of total manufacturing time compared with the traditional process using EDM. However, it is important to note that for specific applications it should be done an analysis of the appropriate processes sequence for each particular case considering the costs and benefits, because there is no sequence that is best in all situations.",

The results of lab-scale bioreactor studies were used to establish the optimum glycerol concentration in the selected media. It was observed that the presence of complex media with a mixture of free amino acids, are suitable for the production of CA. Glycerol showed an optimum value compared to the production of CA in 50 g.L -1 and inhibitory effect was observed at concentrations of 100 g.L -1. With the complex medium and 50 g.L -1 of glycerol, the concentration of CA achieved was 994 mg.L -1. A mathematical model was proposed and their fit to the experimental results was evaluated.

    "Abstract": "The Vehicle Allocation Problem (VAP) consists in allocating a fleet of vehicles to attend the expected demand for freight transportation between terminals along a finite multiperiod planning horizon. The objective is to maximize the profit generated for the completed services. Given the geographical dispersion of freight transportation demand services, it is common that some vehicles accumulate where they are not needed or they lack where they are indeed needed, thus it is important to balance the supply of vehicles and demand for services along the planning horizon. The size of practical problems encountered by logistic transportation companies are significantly large to solve in reasonable computational times, especially in road freight transportation. Consequently, heuristic methods are used to obtain feasible solutions, however, without a quality certificate of the solution. For this reason, this work applies two decomposition methods, which provides quality certificate of the solution, to obtain bounds in good computational times. The methods used are lagrangean relaxation with subgradient optimization and Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition with column generation. Computational experiments with realistic instances show great potential of the bounds in terms of computational efficiency for the second method. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The detection of microseisms due to the movement along fault planes during an artificial filling is not a trivial or easy process. In this work, a new methodology for the detection of possible microseisms produced by the filling of a restored mine hole is presented, based on the data registered by three seismographs set in different parts of the area. To accomplish this detection, it is necessary to preprocess the signals and do a post process, with the aim of isolating the posssible events which could be classed as microseisms. The methodology developed here allows the detection of possible microseisms in the zone of influence, distinguishing in a correct way if the registered movements correspond to seisms produced in the studied area. Thanks to the obtained results, it can be concluded that the methodology is effective in its purpose.",

    "Abstract": "Learning difficulties in Education are some of the most important causes of desertion. One solution has been to use learning and teaching tools in virtual learning environments. These tools facilitate the educational process and improve the cognitive processes in students. However, many tools do not consider the students' particular features, difficulties and levels of disability (all these features compose their profile) that may make it harder to learn. The adaptive virtual learning environments assists students to access course content, to interact with activities and to perform assessment processes, based in their characteristics, needs, difficulties and / or disabilities. This paper presents MDALS (acronym for Adaptive Learning Disability Model System) to characterize a disability and to identify potential difficulties that a student may have in their learning process. This system supports the development of virtual environments, providing personalized and / or adapted services, according to the students' context and profile, to assist their learning.",

    "Abstract": "Nowadays conservative tracers are used in water studies because obtained information is varied and accurate, enhancing the knowledge on fluid dynamics. However, at the same time some theoretical difficulties are found limiting the scope of such studies. Some correspond to the very interpretation of tracer curve, which within the state of the art should be Fickian in nature. In this Article an alternate view is presented starting from a new definition of mean velocity of flow with longitudinal dispersion coefficient as time function which represents well the experimental dye asymmetric curves. Given the accuracy and easiness of this method it may be applied to contamination studies. As an example it is applied herein to a radioactive tracer study documented by H. B. Fischer in 60 \u0301s years; specifically it is discussed the measurement of Activity comparing it with the current method involving the law of conservation of mass and then some remarks are done over the precision of method.",

The niobium coating was obtained by thermal spray process with non-transferred arc plasma and the inconel 625 coating was obtained by shielded metal arc welding. The abrasion resistance was evaluated according to standard Petrobras N-2568, in a tribometer CETR and the coating roughness was determined using profilometry. The coating hardness was determined by Vickers microhardness. The coating morphologies were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy. The high hardness of niobio coatings contributed to reducing the rate wear compared to the inconel 625 coating.",

However, other analyses can be made so that the engineer can bring together more elements into the judgment concerning the foundation behavior. Based on the results from static load tests conducted on caissons, piles and plates executed with a continuous flight auger, this paper shows a set of complementary analyses that can be made with the results from a load test in the geotechnical design of foundations, taking into account the characteristic behavior of each soil and the interaction mechanisms between the foundation structure and the supporting soil.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper the possibility of using the rice husk with and without pretreatment was analyzed, as an addition in the preparation of lightweight mortars. Various pretreatments of rice husk, such as washing with distilled water, acid solution bath for 24 h, basic solution bath for 24 h, and combinations and variations of the above pretreatments have been studied. Properties such as density, flexural and compressive strength of mortars have been tested. Finally, three selected mortars were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy technique. The results showed that mortars with very low density and high porosity were obtained, which make them candidates to produce construction materials for thermal and acoustic insulation, but not for manufacturing bearing elements due to their low mechanical strength. Conclusion are that the chemical treatment of husks with alkaline reagents and the addition of calcium chloride as the curing accelerator are two effective methods for the reuse of this waste in lightweight mortar.",

    "Abstract": "The application of the Hilbert-Huang Transform in series of rainfall, river discharge and temperature, for different temporal resolutions, is studied, in order to identify the principal modes of hydroclimatic variability in Colombia. Results are compared with the traditional methodologies for spectral analysis: the Fourier Transform and the Wavelet Transform. In variables with monthly resolution (precipitation, temperature and river discharge) oscillation modes are associated with periods of 3, 6 and 12 months, 2-3 years and 3.5-6 years, while in daily records, in addition to the aforementioned periods, frequencies are associated with periods of 3.5-5 days and 69-78 days. In hourly series, frequencies are associated with periods of 12 and 24 hours, followed by a frequency of 0.017 h -1 equivalent to 59 hours (2.5 days). The power and superiority of the Hilbert-Huang transform is demonstrated, especially in signals with strong cycles and datasets containing outliers.",

    "Abstract": "The surface free energy (SFE) is a fundamental thermodynamic material property that can be used to quantify the quality of adhesion between diverse materials, the susceptibility of these materials to loss its adhesion due to the presence of water in the system, and the coating ability of a material over another material with different SFE values (i.e., wettability). These principles can be applied to different materials, including the asphalt-aggregate systems (i.e., hot mix asphalt (HMA) mixtures). This research work aims to present an analysis, based on SFE measurements of the asphalt mixture basic constituents, to quantify the adhesion quality, moisture susceptibility, and the coating quality of the asphalt over the aggregate surface (wettability) for different asphalt-aggregate systems. The SFE measurements of asphalts and aggregates were conducted in the laboratory by applying, respectively, the Wilhelmy Plate method and the Universal Sorption Device (USD). The materials assessed included Colombian asphalts and aggregates produced in both Colombia and The United States. The analysis focused on evaluating the effect of industrial asphalt modification processes and filler addition on the quality of adhesion, moisture susceptibility, and wettability of different asphalt-aggregate systems. The results suggest that the SFE measurement of asphalts and aggregates is an efficient tool to assess the compatibility and the expected performance of diverse asphalt-aggregate systems as well as the modifications induced, at a fundamental level, by different processes used in the fabrication of HMA (e.g., mineral filler addition).",

Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) was also tested for comparative purposes and was exposed to identical experimental conditions. The monitoring of open-circuit potential, the linear polarization resistance technique, and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were used to evaluate the corrosion behavior of the steel bar. Corrosion resistance of carbonated AAS and OPC concretes was tested at different times. We carried out an exposure test of a solution containing Cl ions with all series for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Electrochemical measurements show that AAS concrete presents depassivation of the steel embedded in concrete where it is exposed to accelerated carbonation; after this period of time, corrosion resistance decreased due to the presence of chlorides at the steel/AAS interface.",

The COS(t) model and the quadratic interpolation function were used for image correction. The iterative self-organizing cluster analysis is considered for image non supervised classification and the maximum likelihood classifier is taken into account for image supervised classification. 70 GPS land observations and the error matrix analysis, were used for validation process.

    "Abstract": "The inherent uncertainties, subjectivity, and engineering challenges in environmental problems are increasingly being worked upon computing methods based on artificial intelligence (AI), including computerized tools that allow an analyst to use approximate reasoning with incomplete and inaccurate information and with the support of an expert in the field. In order to evaluate the applicability of this tool, this paper presents the development of a new water quality index based on fuzzy logic called the \"fuzzy water quality index\" (FWQI). This index is compared to the NSF water quality index (NSFWQI) and with the water quality index (ARWQI) obtained for the project \"Red R\u00edo Fase I\" for the Medellin metropolitan area environmental authority. The new FWQI provided reasonable correlations and results in comparison to the other two reference indexes. Finally, the FWQI could be used as a decision maker in the water management of Aburra River.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a brief description of vehicular congestion in Medellin, Colombia, and discusses the need to implement congestion pricing (CP) from an economic point of view. It describes the license plate-based traffic restriction (Pico y Placa) in the city, showing that the measure is palliative, and that the implementation of CP is necessary. A cost-benefit analysis is presented to assess the effects of implementing a hypothetical CP strategy based on data from previous studies. The first-best solution for CP is presented, and considered as the optimal policy for deciding on the congestion rate that would maximize social welfare. The main finding is that the net benefit of implementation costs is positive. Therefore, the implementation of a CP strategy is recommended to improve the efficiency of road infrastructure use in the city based on economic principles. Finally, a set of recommendations for improving the city's mobility in the future are presented.",

During the underground passage, a series of physical, chemical, and biological processes take place, improving the quality of the surface water, substituting or reducing conventional drinking water treatment. Despite its extensive use in Europe and its emerging use in the United States, there are no scientific publications related to RBF use in Colombia, although apparently propitious settings exist.

    "Abstract": "One of the most promising device of semi-active control is the magnetorheological (MR) damper, which consists of a hydraulic cylinder, magnetic coils and a stimulate fluid called magnetorheological fluid, whose main feature is its ability to vary from a linear viscous liquid free-flowing state to a semi-solid state in just milliseconds when exposed to a magnetic field. This peculiarity makes the MR dampers an ideal tool for the control of structural systems, because with them it's possible manage damping forces in a simple, fast and secure way to a relatively low cost. This paper analyzes the structural response of a two-story building controlled by a pair of MR dampers operated by a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) associated with a algorithm developed to choose command signal of the clipped optimal controller. The results showed reductions higher than 49% and 76% of peak response and RMS values of response, respectively.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this research was the evaluation of the kinetics and the drying conditions, at laboratory scale, of two yam varieties (D. alata 9506-021 and 9506-027) from the germplasm bank of the University of Cordoba (Colombia). Two geometries (circular and square) were used for the study; the air temperature ranged from 40 to 70 \u00b0C and the air speed was 0.7 m s -1. The experimental data were fitted appropriately to Fick, Page, and Logarithmic models. Mass transfer of the yam slices was described by using Fick's diffusion model, which was the best fitted model. Drying occurred mainly in the decline phase. Arrhenius described properly the dependency of the moisture diffusivity with temperature. Among the temperature range evaluated, moisture diffusivities varied from 1.70 \u00d7 10 -9 to 6.84 \u00d7 10 -10 m 2/s and 1.33 \u00d7 10 -9 to 6.30 \u00d7 10 -10 m 2/s for the D. alata 9506-21 and 9506-27, respectively. The drying activation energy for D. alata 9506-21 and 9506-27 varied from 23.19 to 25.72, and 16.03 to 17.82 kJ/mol, respectively.",

    "Abstract": "Integration stage in the process of three-dimensional reconstruction of free-form objects requires the description, analysis and correction of holes in 3D surfaces. Some quantitative assessments in this issue involve having data regularly spaced or contained in structures to ensure that property, for example, voxels, octrees or structured grids. Achieving this requires a re-sampling of points that make up the contour of the hole in 3D surface. This paper describes a method to obtain structured sets of points from contour data of holes in free-form objects. The method begins with fitting a NURBS curve to the initial set of points in order to ensure the smoothness of the contour, thus obtaining an adjusted set of points. Finally, it is used the Bresenham discretization algorithm to obtain the set of structured points. Results show that the developed method ensures that the final set of structured points preserve original contour shape with high levels of detail.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid prototyping and copying of real 3D objects play a key role in some industries. Both applications rely on the generation of appropriated computer aided manufacturing (CAM) files. These files represent a set of coordinates of an object and can be understood by a computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine. Non-contact techniques, like laser scanning and fringe projection, are among the possibilities for obtaining such CAM files. In this work, a comparison between the two aforementioned non-contact techniques is presented. The comparison is made based on their performance as candidates for generating CAM files of objects of high reflectivity and maximum lateral dimensions of the order of 15 mm The parameters tested are the quality of the 3D reconstruction, the processing time, and the possibility of these being implemented in industrial scenarios, among others. Under the scope of these parameters, it is concluded that laser scanning offers superior performance for the kind of objects here considered. The techniques are evaluated with dental pieces in order to validate these methodologies in the rapid prototyping and copying of teeth.",

    "Abstract": "Using the surface water balance equation, the average annual runoff in the continental zone of the geographic domain of Central America for Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) is estimated, and results are validated along the Colombian Pacific rivers, namely Atrato, San Juan, Baud\u00f3, Pat\u00eda and Mira, using historical streamflow records, as well as streamflows reported in the National Water Study. Precipitation was estimated using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Climate Hazard group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data sets. Actual evapotranspiration was estimated using the Max Planck Institute (MPI) data sets, as well as the Choudhury and Budyko methods based estimates of potential evapotranspiration from Climatic Research Unit (CRU). Results allow concluding that the surface balance equation exhibits an almost perfect closure over the Atrato and Baud\u00f3 Rivers, with errors on the order of 10-20%, whereas for the Mira River errors are on the order of 40%. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Being the corrosion of steel reinforcement due to chloride penetration the major cause of durability problems in concrete, this paper summarizes the results of an experimental research carried out in order to investigate the influence of the silica fume (SF) content on some chloride-related transport properties. To achieve this, the compressive strength, the self-diffusion chloride penetration, the charge passed in a non-steady chloride migration test (ASTM C1202), and the AC resistivity were measured on concrete mixes of high-performance concrete. Four concrete mixes were cast incorporating 5, 10, and 15% of SF as an addition to ordinary Portland cement. The results showed that the silica fume in concrete causes an increase in strength and a reduction in chloride ion permeability; however, clear differences were found between the results of long diffusion and rapid electrical tests.",

    "Abstract": "We report structural analysis, magnetic ordering, ferroelectric behavior, and the electronic structure of Sr 2TiMnO 6 complex perovskite. Samples were produced by the solid state reaction recipe. Crystallographic analysis was performed by Rietveld refinement of experimental X-ray diffraction patterns. Results show that this material crystallizes in a perovskite tetragonal structure which corresponds to the space group I4/mmm. We obtain a matching of 99% between structural properties predicted by the density functional theory and structural ordering, found from the Rietveld refinement method. From field cooling measurements of susceptibility as a function of temperature, we determine the occurrence of a magnetic ordering for a critical temperature of 44.8 K. From a fitting with the molecular field theory of ferrimagnetism, we establish that the ordering corresponds to a paramagnetic-ferrimagnetic transition, which is corroborated by the behavior of the inverse of susceptibility as a function of temperature. The Curie constant allowed for us to obtain an effective magnetic moment of 3.5 \u03bc B. The result of magnetization as a function of the applied field, measured at T = 40 K, shows a ferromagnetic-hysteretic behavior. The curve of polarization as a function of applied voltage evidences a ferroelectric character. It is shown experimentally that below 44.8 K this perovskite material evidences a multiferroic feature. Ab initio calculations of density of states and band structure for this manganite-like material were carried out by means of the density functional theory (DFT) and the linearized augmented plane waves method for both spin orientations. For calculations, the exchange and correlation potentials were included through the local density LDA+U approximation. The density of states study was carried out considering both up and down spin polarizations by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). Results of total and partial density of states reveal the insulator character of this material with an effective magnetic moment of 3.3 \u03bc B.",

    "Abstract": "Stress concentrations at the ends of a flat contact including frictional sliding are analyzed in this article by using the finite element (FE) method. The numerical studies are conducted with a shaft coupled to the hub by conical rings. The applied mesh refinement at the contact ends assures the reliability of the FE results, which show significantly higher stress peaks than those obtained from the conventional analytical solution recommended in the design guidelines of the frictional conical joints. These notch stresses result in low cycle fatigue (LCF) failures of the shaft-hub connection in service, since the yield point of the shaft material can be locally exceeded. The effect of clearances among the joint components and magnitudes of the friction coefficient on variations of the maximum stress in the contact are considered as well. The paper's findings and conclusions are applicable to the design and manufacturing process of the frictional conical joints with regard to assembly tolerances.",

    "Abstract": "The phenomenon of loss of the student status due to low academic performance is a serious problem that affects the main universities of Colombia. Low performance is also related in a direct way to student dropout. This is why it is of fundamental importance to identify factors which can be associated with the student's loss of his/her status due to low academic performance. Based on information about academic performance collected at the National University of Colombia at Medellin, a survival analysis model for discrete time (based on the logit transformation in which the response variable under consideration was the probability for an individual of losing his/her student status for the first time in a determined time) was implemented. This model allowed us to identify and quantify the effect of socio-demographic variables related with the loss of the student status for the first time.",

    "Abstract": "Video compression techniques remove temporal redundancy among frames and enable high compression efficiency in coding systems. Reduction of temporal redundancy is achieved by motion compensation. In turn, motion compensation requires motion estimation. Block matching is perhaps the most reliable and robust technique for motion estimation in video coding. However, block matching is computational expensive. Different approaches have been proposed in order to improve block matching motion estimation accuracy and efficiency. In this paper a block-matching strategy for motion estimation is introduced. In the proposed approach the size of matching block is adapted according to the variability of the matching areas. That is, the block size is constrained by variations of the image intensity. The variability is assessed using two variability measures: the variance and the mean absolute deviation. Results of computer experiments aimed at validating the performance of the proposed approach are also reported.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, an unbalanced magnetron sputtering system which allows for the production of corrosion resistance multilayer coatings is described. The major advantage of this system is that it combines features such as a multi-cathode setup, temperature control, control over the rotation of the sample holder, and the ability to change samples without breaking the vacuum. The system was tested with the production of Cr/CrN nanometric multilayers on AISI stainless steel 304 and silicon (100) substrates and the evaluation of its corrosion resistance. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used in order to assess the crystalline microstructure and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize multilayer formation. The XRD results show (111) and (200) orientations for CrN multilayer films and the SEM results clearly show the formation of a multilayer structure. Corrosion resistance was evaluated through electrochemical studies and the results show that the Cr/CrN multilayer structure presents lower corrosion current and higher corrosion potential as compared to the stainless steel 304 substrate.",

A power-law dispersive behavior of the frequency-dependent conductivity at high frequencies has been observed in all G/S films in the blend compositions prepared, similar to that observed in other solid ionic conductors and known as a \"universal dynamic response.\" The electrical conductivity enhancement is consistent with the subtle changes in the -OH glycerol groups coordination with the starch chains introduced by increasing the glycerol content and temperature. A stable single phase is revealed under the electrical measurement conditions up to approximately 100 \u00b0C for all concentrations, but the stability can be maintained up to higher temperatures (~150 \u00b0C) at glycerol concentrations below G/S = 0.4.",

Such a new step-up power converter provides a low input current ripple injected into the photovoltaic generator, and at the same time provides a low voltage ripple to the load. The developed converter is based on traditional interleaved boost converters interacting with voltage multiplier cells where the circuit symmetry has been broken, obtaining an inherent discontinuous conduction-operating mode that provides a high voltage conversion ratio in comparison to traditional solutions. Such low-ripple and high boosting conditions make this converter an ideal candidate for photovoltaic systems design, in particular for grid-connected applications. The converter circuitry is analyzed, and a design procedure is proposed in terms of typical photovoltaic systems requirements, providing simple but useful equations. Finally, the converter design is illustrated by means of a realistic design example and validated by using an experimental prototype.",

The method and the instrumentation schemes to allow accurate assessment of the three components of deformations for squat walls and walls with openings are proposed. It was found that the proposed method produce consistent results for the tests evaluated.",

    "Abstract": "The biodesulfurization process of coal from the municipality of Puerto Libertador (C\u00f3rdoba, Colombia) with high-sulfur content (S pyritic = 1.03%, S organic = 0.9%, S sulfates = 0.1%) was carried out in a 4,000 L stirred tank reactor. A mixed culture of A. ferrooxidans and A. thiooxidans was used. The process was configured in a discharge-charge system at room temperature with the pH controlled at 1.8\u00b10.1, 4 mg/L of dissolved oxygen, and a coal particle size -3/4 (dp&lt;19.05 mm). Two residence times (D2: 8 days and D1: 4 days) were evaluated. The best results showed 59.22% of pyritic sulfur oxidation with a residence time of 4 days. These results show good expectations for a process which can be applied without having to grind the coal to a fine size. On the other hand, liquid effluents, produced during the biodesulfurization process, were neutralized to a pH of between 7.5-8.5, by adding lime. The neutralization reached removals of 100% total iron, 69.81% sulfates, and 66.09% total solids.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this work was to develop a fuzzy model to classify the working environment in poultry farms. For this purpose, air temperature, relative humidity, noise level, and ammonia concentration were measured in a broiler house with lateral positive-pressure ventilation. Work days consisting of 8 hours were simulated and the results provide support for classifying the level of comfort under different thermal, noise and gas concentration conditions. Therefore, three input variables were used: temperature-humidity index (THI), noise level (dB) and ammonia concentration (ppm), and the output variable was the work environment classification (WEC). Sixty rules were defined based on combinations of THI, noise level and ammonia concentration and each result is a function of the combination of input data. Experimental data was used to test the application of the proposed model. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is promising for determining the worker well-being level, and as an aid in making decisions regarding the control of the work environment in order to reduce or eliminate sources considered stressful to humans.",

    "Abstract": "Zinc oxide and organic polymer (poly-ethylene oxide) based nanocomposite membranes were prepared and their phase relationship investigated. The composites were characterized by XRD, Raman scattering, DSC, and impedance spectroscopy analysis. It was found that embedding inorganic nanoparticles of ZnO into the polymer matrix of PEO allowed for some crystallinity formation, and cross-linking of the polymer composites during annealing or synthesis. The XRD and Raman scattering results show more defined peaks assigned to each phase of the composite as the ZnO content increases from 0 to 30% weight ratio, thus indicating that ceramic filler remain in the semi-crystalline polymer matrix as a separate crystalline phase. The dc-electrical conductivity increases by two or three orders of magnitude from blank (organic phase only) (~10 -6 Scm -1) to the 30 % wt. ZnO composite membrane (~10 -4 Scm -1). Electrical conduction changed as a function of temperature with an Arrhenius-type behavior.",

    "Abstract": "Continuous processes with immobilized cells are a good alternative for improving the efficiency and the performance of alcoholic fermentations. The potential use of raw materials obtained from agro-industrial waste as supports for cell immobilization was recently evaluated. In this work, we evaluated the continuous production of ethanol in packed-bed reactors with yeast cells immobilized on wood shaving, cane bagasse, corn leave, and corn cob lignocellulosic waste. We used glucose as a carbon source to establish the reference conditions and we made the fermentations with commercial sucrose. We also evaluated the glucose syrup obtained from cassava flour as alternative substrate. The experiments were performed on a laboratory level in column reactors of 250 mL. The cane bagasse was the material on which the highest amount of cells was immobilized. A value of 0.047 g Biomass/g Carrier (gX/gC) was obtained. For the fermentation performed with glucose, the productivity reached was 13.33 \u00b1 1.5 g/L h. A similar value, 13.00 \u00b1 0.02 g/L h was reached for the productivity of fermentation with sucrose. In the fermentations performed with glucose syrup, a higher amount of ethanol was obtained in the process that used corn cob as the carrier. 31.99 \u00b1 1.93 g/L of ethanol was produced and the productivity of 10.66 \u00b1 0.64 g/L h was reached. The results obtained have allowed us to establish the potential this lignocellulosic waste has as carriers for cell immobilization for the continuous production of ethanol, and the possibility of using glucose syrup as an alternative substrate.",

Susceptibility is obtained considering various conditioning and triggering factors of instability and the probability of event occurrence is estimated from deterministic methods. The vulnerability analysis is done considering the spatial and temporal components of the potential events, as well as the impact that these could have on the exposed elements, in terms of social and material losses.

    "Abstract": "MEG/EEG brain imaging has become an important tool in neuroimaging. The reconstruction of cortical current flow is an ill-posed problem, but its uncertainty can be reduced by including prior information within a Bayesian framework. Typically this involves using knowledge of the cortical manifold to construct a set of possible regions of neural source activity. In this work a second stage is proposed to reduce localisation error without severely increasing the computational load. This stage consists of iteratively updating the set of possible regions based on previous reconstructions, in order to focus on those brain regions with a higher probability of being active. The proposed methodology was tested with synthetic MEG datasets giving as a result zero localisation error for single sources and different noise levels. Real data from a visual attention study was used for validation.",

    "Abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa) is staple food for more than half of the world population. This cereal contributes a considerable amount of calories to the consumer. Agrotoxics and synthetic fertilizers in agricultural practices have generated environmental damage and the pollution of fruits, which puts consumer health at risk. On the other hand, organic agricultural production requires certification, which frequently is a complicated and expensive process of inspection. For this reason, it is pertinent to look for a scientific discrimination criterion that allows for the certification procedure to be done in an efficient and economical way. In this paper, a photoacoustic spectroscopy study for husk and white grain rice samples of Combeima variety is shown. The samples were taken from crops of rice that were cultivated with organic and conventional techniques. Themophysical parameters of the same kind of samples were measured with the same technique, but in frequency - resolved configuration. Finally, rice grain cell morphology was studied by optical microscopy. The results show important differences among the samples for being used in a certification process.",

    "Abstract": "A complete column classification and the corresponding stability equations for single stepped columns with sidesway inhibited, partially inhibited, and uninhibited, subjected to concentrated axial loads located at the ends and at the intermediate joint including semi-rigid connections and shear force effects are presented using three different approaches. The first two approaches are those by Engesser and Haringx that include the shear component of the applied axial force proportional to the total slope (dy/dx) and to the angle of rotation of the cross section (\u03c8) along the member, respectively. The third approach is a simplified formulation based on the classical Euler theory that includes the effects of shear deformations but neglects the shear component of the applied axial force along the member. Four different types of divergent instability are possible for a single-stepped column subjected to concentric axial loads: 1) buckling with sidesways between the two ends and intermediate joint totally inhibited; 2) buckling with sidesway between the two ends totally uninhibited; 3) buckling with sidesway between the bottom end and intermediate joint totally inhibited; and 4) buckling with sidesways between the two ends and intermediate joint uninhibited or partially inhibited. The stability analysis of a single-stepped column consists of determining the eigenvalue of a 2x2 matrix for the first three types of buckling just mentioned and of a 3x3 matrix for members buckling with sidesways between the two ends and intermediate joint uninhibited or partially inhibited. The definite criterion on the minimum stiffness of lateral bracings for single-stepped columns is also presented. The proposed method is general and can be extended to multi-stepped columns.",

    "Abstract": "Gelling agents are components to solidify media cultures facilitating the isolation of microorganisms in pure cultures. Agar is the most used gelling agent in microbiological field because of properties like gelling temperature and a desirable texture (high firmness and low adhesiveness). A current problem with agar manufacture is that overexploitation of the algae Gelidium spp is affecting the species conservation and has increased agar\u2019s market price by up to 300%. The aim of this research was to propose substitutes of bacteriological agar in terms of texture by using some reported gelling agents used by food and agroindustry. To determine the effects of the components on texture, were proposed a mixture-design screening to establish an optimal mixture that replace agar. The optimal result, according to the desirability function, were composed of arabic gum (2%), gelan gum (0.5%) and carrageenan (0.5%). This mixture exceeds the firmness of the reference matrix (agar at 2%) by 15% and is potentially 25% more cheaper and without significative statistical difference in growth CFU when compared to agar based media. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The primary objective of this research was to determine the effect of the failure criterion, used to compute the laboratory fatigue response of hot mix asphalt (HMA) mixtures specified by the Institute of Urban Development of Bogota D.C. (i.e., md10 and md20 mixtures), on the fatigue response prediction. The fatigue equations (i.e., fatigue curves) were determined using the controlled-strain trapezoidal fatigue test. The criteria used to establish the fatigue life corresponded to the classic (50% of the initial load)-, damage-, and breakage-failure criterion. Corresponding results suggested that the failure criterion selection can lead to significant differences in the laboratory fatigue life prediction (i.e., fatigue curves). However, for the dense-graded md10 mixtures, the fatigue curve was similar in disregarding the failure criteria applied. On the contrary, for the dense-graded md20 mixtures, application of the three failure criteria led to significant differences in fatigue life prediction; the smallest load cycles to failure (most critical) was determined based on the classic criterion. Future research should focus on establishing the failure criterion to be used for subsequent pavement structural design, especially for asphalt mixtures with a maximum aggregate size of 20 mm or higher.",

In this work, we propose a database application method which includes conversion rules that translate formal specifications to implementations in the structured query language (SQL) enhanced with fuzzy logic (SQLf). The novelty of our method is the tuple calculus extension in order to express fuzzy queries with formal specification.

In order to obtain this output, mathematical models such as Petri nets are used to validate concurrent behaviors, presence/absence of blockings, and activity synchronization, among other aspects of this industrial process. Despite its advantages, the use of Petri nets does not allow for the evaluation of other important issues in manufacturing processes, or how to manage them. Therefore, stochastic system simulation and agent technology are used in the experiments to obtain other performance measures. A combination of Petri nets, multi-agent systems, and stochastic systems is used within a proposed method for validating the output of production systems.

However, various technological solutions such as mobile phones cannot be used in places such as meetings, classrooms, or conference rooms without disrupting the activities of people around the speaker. This research develops a tool that enables people to establish a conversation in a public place without disrupting the surrounding environment. To this end, a speech synthesizer is implemented on a personal computer connected to a cell phone, which allows one to establish a mobile call without using the human voice. The speech synthesizer uses the diphone concatenation technique and is developed specifically for the Spanish from Colombia. A mathematical description of the synthesizer shows the decomposition of the synthesizer into various mutually independent processes. Several user-acceptance and quality tests of the obtained signal were performed to evaluate the performance of the tool. The results show a high signal to noise ratio of generated signals and a high intelligibility of the tool.",

    "Abstract": "Information systems (ISs) are composed of functional requirements (FRs) and non-functional requirements (NFRs). An NFR does not determine the function of the system itself, but the quality characteristics of an IS; for example, error handling, auditing, and access control. Non-functional requirements are often included in the coding phase of the IS, and these generally are present in various parts of the source code (i.e., they are scattered and tangled), which implies a difficult concept and even more difficult maintenance. In addition, we know that maintenance works are becoming more frequent due to both the technological and the functional changes of the IS. In this paper we present a proposal to define and include the NFR in the early stages of the analysis and the design of IS development. On the one hand, we use the aspect-oriented software development approach (AOSD) to model and maintain the NFRs as aspects. On the other hand, we use the model-driven engineering approach (MDE) to formalize this approach. For this, we create a unified modeling language (UML) profile. Then, we make use of MDE transformation mechanisms to obtain the complete model (with functional and non-functional aspects), and finally, a source code is generated; but this step is beyond the scope of this paper.",

Existing solutions based on mathematical programming solve a 3-phase ACOPF to optimally exploit the available energy, however, this might increase all reliability problems above if done carelessly. As a solution to optimally exploit DERs (like local photovoltaic and storage systems) without compromising the network reliability, this paper presents a novel algorithm to solve the 3-phase ACOPF as a sequence of convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs. Results show that this solution has a lower voltage unbalance and computation time than its non-linear counterpart, furthermore, it converges to a primal feasible point for the non-linear formulation without major sacrifices on optimal DER active power injections. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Major initiatives in GIS interoperability solve arising problems by defining sets of standards and by specifying development interfaces. Such initiatives allow interoperability between pairs of homogeneous GISs, which hold the same standards or development interfaces, avoiding GIS heterogeneity.

    "Abstract": "This paper discusses the main aspects that drive the design of intelligent tutoring system based virtual learning environments. Most of these virtual learning systems focus on tutor activity and use artificial intelligence techniques. Information about the interaction with these systems is used to create a model that, given the preferences and learning styles of a student, performs an information retrieval process to adapt content delivery to the student, according to his/her particular characteristics (learning style, behavior, performance, and whether the student has a disability or not).",

    "Abstract": "In this article, a review of several models used to explain the mechanical behavior of the articular cartilage is presented. This review makes an emphasis on the mechanical models because the physical-chemical models are out of scope of the solid behavior analysis explained in this study. Most of the revised models retake the idea proposed by Mow which states that this type of tissues can be modeled as a biphasic material where each phase has got its specific characteristics and the interaction among these phases offers the tissue overall mechanical properties. The approach of a phenomenological model for an articular cartilage is complex due to the nature of the transitory loads answer and bonded physical-chemical phenomena. The future models will have to be oriented to consider, in an integrated way, these characteristics and interactions among them.",

    "Abstract": "Hospital wastewaters are considered to be one of the major sources of emergent contaminants as result of the dairy activities and excretion of the patients. Several studies have demonstrated that these compounds are not easily removed in conventional wastewater treatments that use biological process. This study evaluated the removal of the organic matter present in real hospital effluent applying ozone at different pH conditions (3,0, 6,7, 10). Parameters such as UV254, biodegradability ratio (COD/BOD) and color (VIS 436) were measured. Moreover, it was assessed the acute toxicity with Allium cepa L. The results demonstrated that with an ozone dosage of 187 mgO 3/h and pH = 10 the biodegradability increased by 70% and the acute toxicity decreased by 62%, whereas for pH =3,0 both UV 254 and color removal was notable. The ozone application seems to be a viable alternative to treat hospital effluents as a pretreatment of a biological process.",

A method for determining the presence of lead is proposed, using GF-AAS in thermoformed and biodegradable flexible films and flour and starch samples from Cassava. Acid digestion with reflux was optimized and the statistical quality parameters were standardized. The graphite furnace heating program was adjusted through pyrolysis and atomization curves. The working range was from 2.0 to 7.0 \u00b5g/L, with limits of detection and quantification of 0.618 and 1.853 \u00b5g/L, respectively. The precision was evaluated using intermediate precision and repeatability of the method, which showed standard deviations of less than 4.70% and 4.36%, respectively. The percentage of recovery ranged from 94.8% to 106.5%. The results obtained support the suitability of the method for determining the presence of lead. Lead concentrations were below 1 mg/Kg, indicating that these polymers can be used for food containers. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a semantic service platform for implementing the steps of a semantic- and model-driven architecture (MDA)-based method for automated code generation. The code generation is achieved by semantically relating operations in unified modeling language (UML) class diagrams with implemented operations. The relationship among operations is achieved by finding implemented operations with the same post-condition of the operation under implementation. The resultant code is a sequence of invocations to the implemented operations which, acting as a whole, achieve the post-condition of the operation under implementation. Semantics is specified by means of a domain-specific language (DSL), also defined in this paper. Services of the platform and the method are shown in execution in a case study.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper the development of a torsional fatigue testing machine for metallic materials is presented. This machine is considered type I according to the Weibull classification because the fatigue failure is caused by a load of inertial origin. The machine operation is based on the alternating movement that the transmission of a washing machine produces. The inertial load is caused by a flywheel located at the top of the machine. Unlike many machines that generate fatigue-alternating stresses through relocation or the rotation of the specimen on loads that are consistent across time, the design of the machine clearly shows how inertial loads due to the acceleration of the mechanical elements generated loads of alternating character which eventually causes fatigue failures.",

    "Abstract": "Closed-form expressions that can be used to evaluate induced elastic bending moments and second-order deflections in slender prismatic columns with initial geometric imperfections (i.e., initial curvature and out-of-plumbness) and semirigid connections when subjected to eccentric axial loads at both ends, are derived in a classical manner. The proposed approach is based on the classical Euler-Bernoulli theory for columns with uninhibited, partially-inhibited, and totally-inhibited sidesway. The combined effects of initial imperfections, axial load eccentricities, and semirigid connections are condensed into the proposed equations. The effects of shear and axial deformations along the member span are not included. Comparisons of the induced elastic moments, second-order deflections, and critical loads obtained using the proposed approach and those available in the technical literature for classic column cases, are presented in a companion paper. Also, sensitivity studies and several examples are presented in detail. These demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed closed-form equations and the importance of initial imperfections, semirigid connections, and lateral bracing on the second-order behavior and stability of beam-columns. These effects must be taken into account in the analysis and design of imperfect slender columns subjected to high axial loads, particularly when sidesway between its ends is uninhibited or partially inhibited due to possible failure by lateral collapse.",

Control-oriented models are analytically derived to design controllers that regulate the voltage of the photovoltaic panel in agreement with the reference provided by a maximum power point tracking algorithm, aimed at maximizing power production. The proposed models are validated by means of frequency response analyses, and the designed controllers are validated by means of detailed simulations performed in standard power electronics software.

    "Abstract": "Sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are microorganisms that can be used as removal agents in polluted water sources. The use of inorganic substrates in SRB systems could reduce the cost and simplify operation. However, the use of H 2 as an energetic substrate and the production of H 2S as a metabolic product could produce kinetic limitations. The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which the kinetics of a sulphate reduction bioreactor was limited by its gas transfer capacity. Reactor kinetics were monitored by total pressure kinetics without sulphate limitation. It was concluded that the bioreactor design should be based on transfer properties. The uptake rate of H 2 reached a maximum of 10 -4 M/min, equivalent to a sulphate reduction rate of 3.4 g\u00b7L -1\u00b7d -1. The hydrogen mass transfer rate required a k La of 1.48 min -1 at 1.2\u00b710 9 cells/L in order to avoid limitation by H 2 bio-availability (1.23\u00b710 -9 L\u00b7min -1\u00b7cell -1), which is a relevant value for scaling-up purposes.",

    "Abstract": "Several papers which support the area of harmonization of multiple models have recently been proposed. In order to offer a clear and general view of the proposals described in these papers, it is important to carry out an analysis of them. An analysis which seeks to identify, classify, and connect the knowledge concerning the harmonization of models described in these proposals has therefore been carried out in this paper. This analysis is based on the four basic operations of set theory, and has permitted us to establish a definition of and the relationship between the techniques, methods, and concepts discovered in harmonization of models. Certain special considerations and conjectures which should be taken into account when implementing these methods and techniques are also described.",

For this reason, the objective of this paper is to evaluate the efficacy of the current equations for the calculation of the availability of series and parallel systems. For that purpose, the non-manufactured production calculated by these equations was compared with the real non-manufactured production which is a function of the down time of each component. These calculations constituted the deterministic model used in the simulations through Monte Carlo method, for which the statistical software R was used. The results were evaluated by the Kolmogorov Smirnov normality test with the modification of Lilliefors. The comparison of means to evaluate the efficacy of the current equations were performed using the t statistic; for this the data were previously approximated to the normal distribution by the central limit theorem. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

To optimize the activities around the mouth it is essential to understand the hydrodynamic processes taking place in the system, including waves. The average wave regime was determined from numerical simulations of different scenarios of the wind regime in the Colombia Bay. SWAN model was used to simulate the waves in the bay and SMC model was used to simulate the waves in detail around the mouth and the currents associated with breaking waves. The results show that the swell waves have little influence on the wave regime into the Colombia Bay and that the wave average regime and currents are strongly influenced by the intra-annual variability of the wind regime in the study area.",

    "Abstract": "Warm-mix asphalt (WMA) mixtures are asphalt mixtures fabricated at lower temperatures (i.e., 20-50 \u00b0C) than conventional hot-mix asphalt (HMA). Therefore, compared to HMA, WMA offer several engineering, economical, and environmental advantages. However, research is still required to identify the response, properties, and performance of WMA, since it is still a relatively new technology. This paper focuses on the analysis of the internal structure of WMA specimens compacted using both the Superpave Gyratory Compactor (SGC) and the Texas Gyratory Compactor (TxGC). This analysis was conducted in terms of the air voids (AV) characteristics assessed by applying X-ray computed tomography and image analysis techniques. The results obtained suggest that the addition of WMA additives and corresponding reduction of the compaction temperature for SGC specimens did not lead to significant changes in the vertical distribution of total AV content, as compared to that of the control-HMA. However, some differences were reported in terms of the AV size, which suggests the existence of discrepancies in the aggregate packing condition. Therefore, additional research is suggested to fully validate the equivalence of the internal structure of both WMA and HMA.",

    "Abstract": "Soursop fruits (Annona muricata L. cv. Elita) at different ripening stages were evaluated for their physico-chemical characteristics: total soluble solids (TSSs), acidity, and pH. Firmness was determined through the application of puncture textural tests. The modeling and simulation of this parameter was carried out on Autodesk Inventor Professional 11.0 (ANSYS\u00ae Technology). The fruits showed an upward trend regarding TSS and acidity, reaching maximum values of 12.8 \u00b0Brix, 0.74% acidity, and a pH below 3.43; all of which coincide with consumption maturity as observed on day 6. Firmness showed a decreasing trend throughout the entire postharvest period, with values of 79.43 N for day 0, and 3.62 N for day 9. Finite element modeling, the simulation of firmness, and its correlation with experimental data allowed for us to calculate the fracture force of the fruits with an exactness of more than 90%. Since it prevents the physical alteration of the product, this application becomes a nondestructive alternative for firmness assessment, useful in storage, transport, fresh consumption, packaging, and processing.",

Comparisons of the induced elastic moments, the second-order deflections, and the critical loads obtained using the proposed approach, and those available in the technical literature for classic column cases are presented herein. Also, sensitivity studies and several examples are presented in detail which demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed closed-form equations and the importance of initial imperfections, semirigid connections, and lateral bracing on the second-order behavior and stability of beam-columns. Results obtained from the proposed equations are compared with those obtained using the FEM computer program ABAQUS, showing its simplicity and accuracy. The closed-form expressions can be used by researchers and structural engineers to investigate the effects of initial imperfections and semirigid connections on the elastic behavior of columns under heavy eccentric axial loads, including cases with relatively large deflections (< 0.1 times the column span).",

In the case the case of production rate most of the analysis is conducted by decline-curve fitting and little attention has been given to rate-transient analysis. This paper presents the governing equations used for rate-transient analysis in elongated systems and provides examples using the conventional analysis. The methodology allows for the estimation of reservoir permeability, reservoir width and geometrical skin factors. If the test is long enough, reservoir drainage area and well position inside the reservoir can also be determined. The methodology was successfully verified by its application to synthetic cases.",

    "Abstract": "The rate for work related accidents in Spanish mining has decreased during recent years. However, the incidence rate per 100,000 workers in the Spanish mining sector in 2007 was significantly higher than the ones reported in the mining industry of other countries. This result implies that studies and research should be carried out in order to reveal the nature of the factors influencing the high incidence rates of the Spanish mining sector. Thus, this article offers features of the 3 most common types of accident of the Spanish mining industry during the period of 2003-2008. For each type of accident, the analysis proceeds as follows: 1) Modeling of the adjusted exponential distribution in terms of workdays lost; 2) Calculation of the risk index adjusted by age group of injured workers; 3) Identification of the 3 main deviations or immediate causes.",

The complexity of the goal functions and of the combinatorial methods used to find analytical solutions to them is quite high. The search for solutions (Pareto-optima) is better served by the use of genetic algorithms (GAs). In this paper, we analyze the performance of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII), strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm II (SPEAII), and their predecessors, NSGA and SPEA, when these are devoted to scheduling tasks in non-standardized production activities.",

In each subdomain we set parameters that correspond to different wave numbers and therefore presents a heterogeneous medium. Each wave number is predicted by the linear stability theory and correspond to different Turing patterns. The reaction equation chosen is that of Schnakenberg. The results show complex patterns that mix bands and spots, as well as patterns that do not correspond with the original patterns that could be found independently in each subdomain.",

    "Abstract": "Warm mix asphalt mixtures (WMA) are asphalt mixtures produced at reduced temperatures, as compared to conventional hot mix asphalt (HMA). Temperature reductions in the order of 10 to 50 \u00b0C are possible through the incorporation of diverse WMA-type additives. However, different aspects, including the mixture internal structure of WMA, are still an object of research. Consequently, this paper focuses on the assessment of the internal structure of WMA (computed in terms of the connected air voids (CAV) characteristics), fabricated using three WMA additives: Asphamin\u00ae, Sasobit\u00ae, and Evotherm\u00ae. The CAV content corresponds to the fraction of air voids (AV) forming connected paths in a compacted specimen and is better related to the asphalt mixture response (e.g., permeability) than the total AV content. The CAV analysis was based on X-ray computed tomography scanning and subsequent image analysis. Corresponding results suggest the need for additional research to further characterize field compacted mixtures, produced at densification levels comparable to those achieved in the laboratory. In addition, the inclusion of WMA additives and corresponding temperature reductions did not substantially affect the internal structure of gyratory-compacted specimens (115 mm in height) produced for laboratory mixture evaluation.",

    "Abstract": "Digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) is perhaps the simplest methodology to obtain three-dimensional information about the micrometer world: a point source and a digital recording device is the hardware needed. In this microscopy technique, the recovery of the complex amplitude scattered by the specimens, relies on quite robust algorithms operating on two-dimensional intensity recordings; each recording is formed by millions of pixels. The elapsed time for carrying out such information processing has concealed the wider application of DIHM. In this paper, by the use of the power provided by the graphics processing units (GPU) along with a reduced number of operations, a methodology for numerical reconstruction at video rate of DIHM holograms is presented. This strategy allows for reconstructing 1 megapixel DIHM holograms up to 32 frames per second with no change in spatial resolution performance of this lensless microscopy architecture. The experimental results shown on this paper exhibit the three-dimensional capabilities of DIHM operating at video rate: a hologram taken from a two-dimensional self-organised monolayer of micrometer sized beads is reconstructed a video rate.",

The latter is the one arising from the material sedimentation process. In this work, the inherent anisotropy of a Kaolin clay is studied. For this purpose, soil samples are prepared with a proposed method producing samples with horizontal and vertical sedimentation axes. The samples go thru permeability tests, unconfined compression tests, oedometric compression tests and direct shear tests and the results carefully analyzed from the constitutive modeling point of view using the hypoplastic model for clays by [1]. Later, identify parameters depending on the inherent anisotropy; then perform some simulations to evaluate the model performance upon different samples with vertical and horizontal sedimentation angles.

    "Abstract": "This research studies biotechnology applied to civil engineering construction in order to improve the physical, mechanical and hydraulic behavior of tropical soils. The method used is considered environmentally clean as this process is not a method of incorporation of certain microorganisms to the soil or addition of specific microorganisms into nutrient media. The process used consists in adding only B4 nutrient to the soil (15g of calcium acetate, 4g of yeast extract and 5g of glucose to 1 liter of distilled water, pH = 8.0), which induces the precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals (biomineralization), caused by the native bacteria existing in the soil. The improvement of the mechanical and hydraulic behavior occurs in about fifteen days after the addition of the nutrient, which is verified by tests compatible with the application of the soil such as shear strength, density, permeability, erosion potential, etc. Soil improvement is a consequence of the increase of soil structural stability. This result is quite favorable to the activities of civil engineering related to construction, maintenance and preservation of civil works in general.",

In this paper, new algorithm and mathematic techniques are reviewed and discussed, and also compared with traditional techniques, revealing the precision and superiority achieved with these new techniques. ST and WT is detailed, basically, as a tool with great scope and future in power quality analysis because of its precision, noise immunity and its contribution with quality information about PQ.",

The degree clogging of drippers was obtained for discharge variation coefficient (DVC). For the swine wastewater application there was increase of DVC, along the time of operation, only in the subunit with dripper G2. The emitters of larger discharge and short pathway length are less susceptible to the clogging. The biofilm formation was resultant of the interaction between suspended solids, sulfur and bacteria consisting on the main factor of partial and total clogging of drippers.",

Paints formulations are based in natural rosin as binder, and cuprous oxide as biocide. Three different plasticizers and binder/plasticizers ratios were employed, obtaining 22 different formulations, which were classified in three different groups according to their biocide leaching rate. Besides this, three commercial products were tested for comparison. Some of the experimental formulations, including paints with low biocide release rate, show as good or better performance than the commercial ones. From the plasticizers employed (chlorinated rubber, vegetable oleic acid, and vegetable oil), it was found that the best results were obtained with formulations prepared with chlorinated rubber. It was also observed that physical chemical water properties might have an important effect on paint efficiency, particularly the presence of particulate matter in the water or important variations of water oxygen content.",

    "Abstract": "Although in the public literature there are several studies that describe models of alkaline delignification, they were originally developed for the paper industry, and do not include the effects of important operating variables such as temperature, hydroxide-ion concentration, solid to liquid weight ratio, particle size, biomass composition (hemicellulose, lignin fraction) and mixing. This lack of detailed models of the pretreatment stages prompted the current study that describes a model which includes the variables listed above and provides an important tool for predicting the degree of lignin removal in lignocellulosic materials such as sugarcane bagasse (Saccharum officinarum L). The model considers kinetic expressions available in the literature. The kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the model to experimental data obtained for that purpose in our lab. The experimental matrix considered eighteen, 24-h isothermal experiments in which bulk and residual delignification stages were observed to occur in a parallel manner. Carbohydrate removal and hydroxide consumption were related to lignin removal by effective stoichiometric coefficients that were calculated by fitting the experimental data. A mixing compartment network model that represented mixing inside the reactor was included into a temporal superstructure based on the similarity between plug flow reactors and ideal batch reactors to model a non-ideally mixed batch reactor. The kinetic model was validated with data obtained in this study.",

    "Abstract": "Moisture adsorption isotherms for yellow pitahaya fruits were studied at 15, 25, and 35 \u00b0C using the gravimetric method for a 0.111-0.901 water activity range. Experimental values were adjusted by using the GAB, BET, Henderson, Smith, Caurie, and Peleg models. The isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) was determined using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The results showed that yellow pitahaya fruits exhibit type III adsorption isotherms and that the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) is temperature-dependent. For the same water activity value, the EMC decreased when temperature increased. The GAB model presented the best fitto the experimental values. The Qst dropped from 57.154 to 45.79 kJ/mol when the EMC increased from 0.05 to 0.40 g water/g dry matter, respectively. These results are important for establishing the best storage conditions for dehydrated pitahaya fruits as well as for shelf-life prediction and the design of packaging materials.",

The fault detection is carried out using the negative sequence analysis and spectral analysis of current signals. An experimental analysis is presented, showing the advantages and drawbacks for each method implemented. Tests are performed in a 2 Hp induction motor dedicated to this type of study. Experimental results show variations in the fault indicator in both methods when the motor is running under different load conditions. Although the negative sequence current method demands simultaneous three phase current sensing, it presents better performance for short fault detection and provides a fault severity level estimation.",

From the numerical results, it is shown that regardless of the saturated permeability of the soil slope, the increase in the pore water pressure (reduction in suction) during rainfall infiltration is localized close to the slope surface. In addition, the generation of the pore water pressure and the lateral displacement are mainly controlled by the ratio of the rainfall intensity to the saturated permeability of the soil.",

In this study we present the results of research devoted to preliminary analysis on several vegetable (biomass) species potentially useful for producing biodiesel. The bioprospection zone is a region on the Colombian Pacific coast. The candidate species collected underwent different standardized ASTM tests in order for us to define properties that facilitate their evaluation. Some of the species underwent a transesterification process. Comparisons between the thermo-physical properties of the biofuels obtained and the properties of commercial diesel were carried out. Also, performance tests for these biofuels were conducted in compression ignition engines, particularly evaluating efficiency, fuel consumption, and potency at different RPMs.",

    "Abstract": "This paper is focused in the development of a hybrid approach based on support vector machines (SVMs) which are used as a regression technique and also in the Chu-Beasley genetic algorithm (CBGA) which is used as an optimization technique to solve the problem of fault location. The proposed strategy consists of using the CBGA to adequately select the best configuration parameters of an SVM. As a result of the application of this strategy, a well-suited tool is obtained to relate a set of inputs to a single output in a classical regression task, which is next used to determine the fault distance in power distribution systems, using single end measurements of voltage and current. The proposed approach is initially tested in a simplified regression task using two functions in \u00c21 and \u00c22, where the results obtained are highly satisfactory. Next, the selection of the adequate calibration parameters is performed in order to adjust the SVM using a cross validation strategy, where an average error of 5.75 % is obtained. These results show the adequate performance of the proposed methodology which merges SVM and CBGA into one powerful fault locator for application in power distribution systems.",

    "Abstract": "A dynamic model of a novel oscillatory cutting brush for street sweeping in free rotation is developed. The bristles are modelled as cantilever beams. The equation of motion is determined through the theory of forced transverse vibrations of beams, and the solution is based on the normal-mode method. A sinusoidal angular speed function and a novel function, named VAP, are studied. The model is validated through finite element analyses. The effects of brush parameters on brush dynamics are identified. Notably, for the VAP function, a condition similar to resonance tends to occur in the stronger plane for bending deflections, when the frequency of the brush is an odd fraction of a natural frequency of the bristle for that plane. The model can also be applied to study the dynamics of a small-deflection cantilever beam, when the transverse external force is a squared, sinusoidal, triangle, or VAP wave.",

Key psychological variables of behavior involved in the choice of transportation mode in a population sample of the Metropolitan Area of the Valle de Aburr\u00e1 were detected. The experiment used the random utility theory for discrete choice models and reasoned action in order to assess beliefs. This was used as a tool for analysis of the psychological variables using the sixteen personality factor questionnaire (16PF test). In addition to the revealed preference surveys,two other surveys were carried out: onewith socio-economic characteristics and the other with latent indicators. This methodology allows for an integration of discrete choice models and latent variables. The integration makes the model operational and quantifies the unobservable psychological variables. The most relevant result obtained was that anxiety affects the choice of urban transportation mode and showsthat physiological alterations, as well as problems in perception and beliefs, can affect the decision-making process.",

    "Abstract": "This paper explains the methodology and criteria used in the development of a new tool for the management of a safeguard plan for historic buildings in Avila, which is a Spanish World Heritage City. As a result of a first approximation, there are many requirements to take into account: completeness, interactivity, ease of use, modularity, and low costs. Due to the characteristics of the information (spatially located, heterogenic, and provided in different formats) we consider it indispensable to create a spatial information system that is qualified for organizing all available multimedia digital information (2-D images, panoramas, graphics, text documents, and music). While the main objective of this study is to provide a simple tool for the management of historic and artistic heritage in the form of a safeguard plan, the features of the tool created here open up new possibilities for other uses in the future.",

    "Abstract": "This paper proposes an approach for a more effective definition of cellular automata transition rules for landscape change modeling using an advanced spatial metrics analysis. This approach considers a four-stage methodology based on: (i) the search for the appropriate spatial metrics with minimal correlations; (ii) the selection of the appropriate neighborhood size; (iii) the selection of the appropriate technique for spatial metrics application; and (iv) the analysis of the contribution level of each spatial metric for joint use. The case study uses an initial set of 7 spatial metrics of which 4 are selected for modeling. Results show a better model performance when compared to modeling without any spatial metrics or with the initial set of 7 metrics.",

    "Abstract": "Taking into account the increasing use of high-strength concrete as a structural material in Colombia, this paper shows the results of research carried out to investigate the effect of different types of coarse aggregate on the static elastic modulus, the compressive strength, the concrete density, and the pulse velocity. To do this, concrete mixes were cast using three different water binder ratios (w/c) (0.36, 0.32, and 0.28). Ordinary Portland cement and pulverized silica fume (SF) were used as cementitiuos materials, while four types of coarse aggregates obtained from different sources near Bogota, Colombia were utilized to prepare the concrete samples. Results were analyzed statistically and these showed that the behavior of all the tests followed a normal frequency distribution. Correlations were found among the mixes. From the experimental data obtained in this study, it was concluded that the equations proposed in standard codes overestimated the modulus of elasticity of high-strength concrete, so empirical equations were obtained in order to predict the elastic modulus of elasticity in high-strength concrete.",

Nevertheless, the conceptual aids for designers and developers of this type of games are scarce, particularly the aids that focus on interaction between players. Due to this, CosModel is proposed as a model for the design of social network games. CosModel is made up of three interaction design views that aid in the construction of these games and focus on enhancing player interactions. One of these views features the use of a metaphor as a conceptual aid for the design of social network games. This paper presents the theoretical background that supports the model, the model's development procedure and structure, and a proposed process for its implementation.",

    "Abstract": "Recycled paper sludge is a promising raw material for ethanol production. In this study, we first evaluated the effects of ethanol concentration, solids load, and cellulose crystallinity on the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose to produce reducing sugars. We then evaluated the production of ethanol by either saccharification and simultaneous fermentation (SSF) or separated hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) using the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus ATCC 36907. We found that cellulose hydrolysis decreased as ethanol concentrations increased; at 40 g/L ethanol, the reducing sugar production was decreased by 79 %. Hydrolysis also decreased as solids load increased; at 9 % of solids, the cellulose conversion was 76 % of the stoichiometric production. The ethanol yield and cellulose conversion rate were higher with SSF as opposed to SHF processes at 72 h of treatment.",

This paper shows the results of a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the state of the art of marketing in the construction industry. The study was conducted through a literature search, with subsequent processing and analysis of the papers found. Despite the efforts made in the last decade, it is difficult to generalize how to apply marketing in construction companies, due to the special features of this sector. Nevertheless, there is a range of possible strategies that could be used by construction companies, and once they know their clients' needs they will be able to choose what strategies to apply. Research gaps such as marketing implementation, marketing differentiation according to the type of clients, and application of information technologies are proposed.",

    "Abstract": "The major sources of water pollution can be classified as municipal, industrial, and agricultural. Different types of polluted aqueous effluents and sediments may be produced, which contain relatively high levels of heavy metals. During the 1990s, the large-scale development of constructed wetlands around the world drew much attention from public and environmental groups. The present study looks at the use of an integrated remediation system using zeolites for the treatment of wastewater and sediments. Zeolites have been widely studied in the past 10 years due to their attractive properties such as molecular-sieving, high cation exchange capacities, and their affinity for heavy metals. Coal industry by-products-based zeolites (faujasite type) have been tested as an effective and low-cost novel alternative for wastewater treatment, particularly their removing of heavy metals. On the other hand, a preliminary laboratory-scale experiment was conducted on the use of natural zeolites (clinoptilolite type) for the retention of heavy metals from canal sediments. Experimental work revealed promising results, which could be replicated on a bigger scale. Although this has been developed for canal sediments, the remediation strategy can be adapted to different waterways such as rivers. The development of the proposed remediation system in a specific experimental site as the major part of an innovation park can provide great benefits to a population living near contaminated effluents. It provides not only opportunities for the mitigation of environmental impact, improving water quality and landscape amenity, but also allows for several recreational opportunities.",

The variables studied were the web steel ratio, the type of web reinforcement, and the testing method. By means of the measured response, it was verified that loading history of the QSC testing ignores the foremost dynamic effects observed in structures subjected to earthquake loads. When dynamic and QSC responses were compared, it was apparent that stiffness and strength degradation properties depend on the loading rate, the strength mechanisms associated to the failure modes, number of cycles, and cumulative parameters such as ductility demand and energy dissipated. We deducted that data obtained from QSC tests cannot always be safely assumed to be a lower limit of the expected capacity. Stiffness and strength degradation models for RC walls with openings subjected to earthquake-type loading are also proposed.",

    "Abstract": "Identifying, quantifying, and minimizing technical risks associated with investment decisions is a key challenge for mineral industry decision makers and investors. However, risk analysis in most bankable mine feasibility studies are based on the stochastic modelling of project \"Net Present Value\" (NPV)which, in most cases, fails to provide decision makers with a truly comprehensive analysis of risks associated with technical and management uncertainty and, as a result, are of little use for risk management and project optimization. This paper presents a value-chain risk management approach where project risk is evaluated for each step of the project lifecycle, from exploration to mine closure, and risk management is performed as a part of a stepwise value-added optimization process.",

    "Abstract": "This work presents a numerical study of the instability line that relies on balance laws of physics rather than phenomenology. The instability line defines the onset of static liquefaction for loose sandy materials in the p-q space of effective stresses under undrained loading conditions. The onset of static liquefaction is predicted by means of a recently developed criterion and specialized to an elastoplastic constitutive model. The performance of this criterion is compared with laboratory tests showing satisfactory results. For a given void ratio and different mean pressures, it is found that the mobilized friction angle at the onset of static liquefaction is not constant. Therefore, the instability line is not an intrinsic property of the sand, but depends on the current state of the material. This work re-interprets the hypothesis given by VaidandChern, which has been amply used to analyze liquefaction phenomena.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this paper is to propose a new method of fuzzy discriminant analysis, which makes use of supervised learning strategy and uses the Euclidean distance as dissimilarity measure. The proposed formulas can solve problems of discrimination and classification of objects in categories which cannot be defined precisely because they have some overlapping degree. In order to illustrate the proposed method, we used a well-known reference database in pattern recognition. We presented the surfaces of membership functions for some examples. Additionally, the method proposed was compared with the Fisher's proposal for showing that the contour plot of 0.5 membership degree coincide with the discriminant linear model when two categories are considered. Finally, we concluded that the technique proposed is easy to implement and computationally efficient. \u00a9 2012 2006, Revista DYNA.",

    "Abstract": "There are three key aspects to consider in designing an adaptive control system. The first aspect is related to the nature of the traffic phenomenon. This is far of being approached from the perspective of a deterministic model. The second, is inherent to a physical reality, considering that the road network, regardless of their design and/or establishment support a maximum traffic flow and a maximum density defined by their size, number of lanes and traffic conditions. All demonstrate, that more sophisticated than the system is, it is not possible to improve the performance of traffic flow per unit of time, beyond the physical limitations imposed by the road design and traffic regulations. On the other hand, initial investment costs plus operating costs and external costs related to the efficient flow of traffic are a third factor to consider as a result of the previous two. Likewise, the magnitude of the cost will largely depend on the degree of intelligence that is allocated on the strategy to implement the technology used in the detection and communication system. \u00a9 2012 2006, Revista DYNA.",

    "Abstract": "Titanium-doped tungsten disulfide thin films (WS 2 -Ti) were deposited using a DC magnetron co-sputtering on AISI 304 stainless steel and silicon substrates. Different Ti cathode power densities between 0 and 1.25 W/cm 2 were used for coating deposition. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy evidenced an increase in Ti percentage at the expense of W, as well as a sulfur deficiency. Raman spectroscopy was used to identify bands corresponding to W-S for undoped WS 2 . As the material was doped, changes in crystalline structure caused W-S main bands to separate. Scratch adhesion testing showed that Ti percentage increased along with the critical load (Lc). Furthermore, adhesive failure type changed from plastic to elastic. Finally, corrosion resistance analysis using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that, at high Ti concentrations, corrosion resistance was enhanced as Ti facilitates coating densification and generates a protective layer. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper an efficient algorithm for probabilistic analysis of unbalanced three-phase weakly-meshed distribution systems is presented. This algorithm uses the technique of Two-Point Estimate Method for calculating the probabilistic behavior of the system random variables. Additionally, the deterministic analysis of the state variables is performed by means of a Compensation-Based Radial Load Flow (CBRLF). Such load flow efficiently exploits the topological characteristics of the network. To deal with distributed generation, a strategy to incorporate a simplified model of a generator in the CBRLF is proposed. Thus, depending on the type of control and generator operation conditions, the node with distributed generation can be modeled either as a PV or PQ node. To validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the IEEE 37 bus test system is used. The probabilistic results are compared with those obtained using the Monte Carlo method. \u00a9 2012 2006, Revista DYNA.",

    "Abstract": "Analyzing alterations in water availability due to natural climatic variability and climate change is important in developing adaptive responses to current and future changes in regional precipitation patterns. In order to understand these changes, spatial and temporal historic fluctuations in regional rainfall patterns must be analyzed. In this context, precipitation trends were analyzed using a non-parametric statistic Mann-Kendall test for annual, seasonal and monthly rainfall between 1975 and 2006 for 108 precipitation ground stations located in the upper and middle Cauca river basin. The results demonstrate that the significant trend of annual rainfall variation was between -9.3% (-147,3mm) and +6.5% (+128mm) per decade and the average change was -0.7% per decade for 24 stations.In the seasonal intra-annual analysis of June-July-August, a period of lower intra-annual rainfall, we found the largest statistically significant decrease in seasonal rainfall, with an average of -15% per decade, in 19% (21) of the total stations. The conclusions are that the pattern of seasonal precipitation changed between 1975 and 2006 and before to compare the annual rainfall trends with geographic variables (latitude, longitude and altitude), we found that rainfall had decreased in all cases above 1500 m in altitude and in latitudes lower than 3o52'N within the Andean Mountains. These changes in precipitation will decrease the volume and availability of runoff, which will alter the water availability in the river basin. In order to design adaptation practices in future investigations, is necessary to study daily rainfall changes and its impacts on the inhabitants of the Cauca river basin. \u00a9 2012 2006, Revista DYNA.",

In this paper, we reconstructed the Low Atrato River's water levels and assessed the effect of the ENSO phenomenon in the river level over the past 150 years using the tree rings of Prioria copaifera tree (Cativo). We demonstrated the annuality of the growth rings by 14C, and by correlations with annual climatic variables. To reconstruct river levels, we used 23 ring width series, and standard dendrochronology methods to cross-dating, detrending, standardize the series, remove the serial autocorrelation, and calculate both Arstan and Residual chronologies. We found positive and significant association (r=0,589; p<0,01) between water levels and Cativo's growth. Residual chronology Cro4R correlated significant and positively with SOI, and the opposite with ONI of ENSO.

Normally, the necessary parameters -producer and consumer's risk, and acceptable and limiting quality level- are assigned by either producer or consumer seeking their individual benefit. Making decisions in this way does not take into account the damage that a nonconforming product generate to the society, for example the injuries produced by a defective machine to operators. In the present study we develop a model that combines single acceptance sampling plans by attribute with the control chart for number of nonconforming products. The model maximizes social welfare by finding optimal pricing policies, sample size, and acceptance number. This methodology allows identifying unexpected changes in the production process and implementing recovery plans for customer affected by nonconforming products. Finally, our methodology also enhances the implementation of plans for continuous improvement. \u00a9 2012 2006, Revista DYNA.",

    "Abstract": "The abnormal glow discharge applied to the sintering process is a technique recently used for processing both metallic and ceramic materials. This represents a decrease in the time required for sintering and lower energy consumption. These two facts are due to the reactive species generated in the plasma and because the heating is done directly by the bombardment of ions and neutral atoms on the surface of the sample, which is usually placed on the cathode discharge. In this paper we use the abnormal glow discharge of low pressure as an alternative method for the sintering step of the ceramic YBa2Cu3O7-d. The physical properties of samples sintered in glow discharge were compared with the properties of samples sintered in resistive furnace, which is commonly used for production of such materials. Then, a structural analysis is carried out by XRD and microstructural analysis by SEM of YBa2Cu3O7-d samples, which were sintered by the two methods. The experimental results allowed to establish a similar structure for both cases and a lower surface porosity in the samples sintered by plasma. In addition, in the plasma sintering process, the samples show a slight contamination of the surface. The contamination is produced due to sputtering of cathode material of the discharge and can be easily removed by mechanical methods (sanding). \u00a9 2012 2006, Revista DYNA.",

    "Abstract": "The selection of portfolios under the Media-Variance (M-V) model work bad when it is exposed to the presence of atypical data that generate error estimation of the parameters In order to minimize this estimation error, we investigate new robust methodologies and their financial performance in terms off the ratio Sharpe, of the turnover index and of the variance. The estimation of the covariance matrix parameter is done with three different robust methods that seek to minimize the instability generated by atypical data, the first is the great contribution of this research, which consists in shrinking the covariance matrix with a cut-out to the mean, the second and third methods are chi-square cut-outs in the distance of Mahalanobis and Minimum Determinant of the Covariance Matrix (MCD) respectively. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Among renewable energy, wind energy is the most commonly used because it is competitive from the standpoint of cost and general permits for construction are easily obtained. However, despite its advantages, the use of wind also presents two the most serious disadvantages from the engineering point of view: the energy efficiency of electric generators and the impact that wind farms cause on the power system. The improvement in one of the limitations could adversely affect the other, so the solution must be found for both problems in tandem. Given this problem posed, it is of fundamental importance for the analytical study of the wind generators operating schemes, to determine which scheme is able to transfer the largest energy value, thus improving the wind utilization and reducing their power system impact. \u00a9 2012 2006, Revista DYNA.",

This technique starts only from the manufacturer data, and significantly improves the errors identified in other techniques. The results are compared with experimental data from a three-phase induction motor of 100 hp, and show marked differences between the behavior obtained with the single-cage model and the obtained one with the double-cage model. This difference may affect the performance of applications which include induction motors, such as control systems, analysis, simulation and emulation of electric drives, among others. \u00a9 2012 2006, Revista DYNA.",

The experimental design was a response surface central composite design with two factors and two levels (temperature: 48 - 80 \u00b0 C and agitation: 400 - 600 rpm) in liquefaction stages previous, and then the temperature was adjusted to 37 \u00b0 C keeping the other conditions in the integration process of the stages. The experimentation was developed with a solids concentration of cassava flour of 28% w/v, pH 5.3, inoculums of 0.75 g/l of yeast Ethanol Red \u00ae, and an enzyme concentration of 4 ml / l. The temperature is variable with greatest effect on the production of ethanol when compared to the agitation, though; both factors have statistic significance on the response variable. A 64 \u00b0 C and 500 rpm is reached an ethanol concentration of 14.6% v/v and a productivity of 2.5 g/lh (at 48 hours of processing). \u00a9 2012 2006, Revista DYNA.",

Different combinations of these parameters were applied for the SAW process. The geometry of the weld metal was measured throughout a 360 \u00b0 sweep with 38 measurements for each sample. The models were then validated through control charts. It was observed that increasing the intensity of current and heat input, increases the weld bead geometry, penetration, width and height. The opposite occurs with an increase in the welding speed. \u00a9 2012 2006, Revista DYNA.",

    "Abstract": "The enzymatic hydrolysis of waste (leaves and top cane) from the harvest of sugar cane was evaluated. The substrates were prepared by applying different delignification treatments using enzymes, organic solvents, sodium hydroxide, and sodium chlorite. Wastes with no treatment were used as control. Five mixtures of enzymes were prepared by using the enzymatic activities of the commercial enzymes, and were evaluated in the different substrates. A criterion for evaluating the efficiency of enzymes from progress curves, percentage saccharification and saccharification index, called \"global index of hydrolysis\" was introduced. The results shows that the hydrolysis with E5 enzymatic preparation with the following enzyme activities, hemicelullases: 52.75 global units of /ml, total cellulase: 27.53 FPU / ml, endoglucanase: 1782.1 CMC / ml, exoglucanase: 0.377 UI / ml, \u03b2-glucosidase: 550 pUPG U / ml, xylanase: 28.23 UI / ml, galactosidasa: 7.1 UI / ml, manase: 2.76 UI / ml, and ranmanasa: 14.63 UI / ml, and the S3 substrate with 80.53% of cellulose content, 13.35% of hemicellulose, 1,36 % of lignin, and Kappa Number of 5.85 has the highest overall index of hydrolysis,117.16.

The adsorption was studied using simultaneous measurements of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) in a temperature range of 25\u00b0C to 45\u00b0C, and protein variations between 5 and 20 mg/ml phosphate buffer solution of pH 7,4. Increasing protein concentration in the electrolyte reduces resistance to charge transfer associated with the interaction between protein and electrode, thus showing a greater adsorption on the surface, confirmed by the increased mass measured by QCM. With the electrochemical polarization, the hydrophilicity of PLA coating was improved, showing a higher affinity and adsorption capacity with collagen-rich solutions. \u00a9 2012 2006, Revista DYNA.",

    "Abstract": "The two-dimensional transient momentum, heat and mass transfer for agrofood processes is described. These processes are: pre-harvest and fruit hot-air dehydration. The methodology includes mathematical modeling and computational simulation to describe conjugate heat and mass convection and diffusion between food and surrounding air. The mathematical model is written in terms of a system built based on the non-linear coupled partial differential equations of continuity, linear momentum, energy and mass. Temperature and concentration dependent fruit thermophysical properties were calculated from empirical models. The finite volume method with the SIMPLE algorithm is used to obtain the results of velocity (v), temperature (T) and moisture concentration (C) distributions in time for the processes studied. The validation procedure includes a comparison with v, T and C experimental and numerical results obtained in the specialized literature. \u00a9 2012 2006, Revista DYNA.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this work is the estimation of azimuth of the horizontal minimum stress (AHMS) in the North zone of the Cupiagua field, located in the Piedemonte Llanero, using like fundamental tool the geostatistics. The methodology for the data's treatment consisted of the conversion of the azimuthal values (circular variable) to numeric data by means of the sine function with the purpose to avoid incompatibilities in the error's measurement. The geostat\u00edstics analysis showed that the space variability of the data is concurrent with an effect nugget of 0, 0017 plus an exponential model with equal sill to 0, 0087 and an infl uence range of 7874 feet. The direction of the AHMS, considered by the ordinary block kriging method, indicated that values AHMS vary between 11\u00b0- 65\u00b0, with a value average of 34\u00b0, where as the estimation error varies between 2\u00b0 and 7\u00b0. The obtained results allowed differentiating two fields from direction of different horizontal minimum stress: one to the north, where the AHMS tends to values inferior to 40\u00b0 and they represent 75% of the calculated data; where as 25% of the remaining data surpass the values obtained in the north, probably had to a greater structural complexity of the zone.",

    "Abstract": "The study of absorption refrigeration systems has had increasing importance in recent years due to the fact that the primary energy that is used in an absorption system can be heat available from a residual source or even a renewable one. Therefore, these systems not only use energy that would be rejected by the environment, but also they avoid the consumption of expensive fossil or electrical energies. The production cost of the mechanical work necessary to obtain a kW of refrigeration for mechanical compression cycle is normally higher than the cost for recovering the needed heat to obtain the same kW in an absorption cycle. Also, the use of these systems reduces impact on the environment by decreasing the emission of CO2. We intend to show the performance of a hybrid absorption-ejecto compression chiller compared to conventional double- and single-effect water/lithium bromide systems, by means of an exergetic and exergoeconomic analysis of these configurations in order to calculate the exergy-based cost of a final product. The vapor compression refrigeration system is included in the results, as a comparisson to the performance of the absorption refrigeration systems analyzed.",

After the seed of the Hass avocado (AS) had been dehydrated at 50\u00b0C for 10 hours, we undertook a quality and analysis of the moisture and microbiological test. The extract was obtained in hot water and in solvents to perform an antimicrobial sensitivity test, which is an inhibition halo test using the strain Staphylococcus aureus as microorganisms. A minimum capacity inhibition test was also carried out. The concentration of the extract by solvents was 7 mg/mL, and it presented an inhibition halo of 1.8mm.The combination of AS and nitrites caused oxidation and darkening in the halos.

Among such developments are graphics processing units (GPUs). These devices are intended to alleviate the central processing unit (CPU) of the host computer from the computation that creates \"life\" for video games. The GPUs reach this goal with the use of multiple computation cores operating on a parallel architecture. Such features have made the GPUs attractive for more than the development of video games. In this paper, a brief description of the features of compute unified device architecture (CUDA\u2122), a GPU parallel computing architecture, is presented. The application of GPUs on the numerical reconstruction of holograms from a digital in-line holographic microscope is shown. Upon the completion of this experiment, we reached an 11-fold acceleration with respect to the same calculation done on a typical CPU.",

    "Abstract": "The modification of a Colombian montmorillonite-type clay with a policationic biopolymer -chitosan- was studied, and the effect of the molecular weight of the modifier on the effectiveness of the modification treatment was evaluated. A Na-montmorillonite clay was used as starting material, which was subjected to a specially developed modification treatment with different concentrations of high and low-molecular weight chitosan. Samples of modified clay were analyzed by X-Ray Diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) in order to identify the possible effects of the modification treatment on the structure of the clay. The results showed a direct relation between the increase in the interlayer spacing of the modified clay and the concentration of chitosan, finding a maximum increase of 1,559 nm for a 2:1 ratio of low molecular weight chitosan:clay. In general, a greater interlayer separation of the clay was detected when low-molecular weight chitosan was used as modifier, compared to that of high-molecular weight chitosan, even though an effective integration of modifying agent to the structure of the clay was observed in both cases. IR analysis of the modified clay made evident the presence of CH, NH2+, CH2 y NH from the chitosan, while TG analysis suggested some degree of hydrofobicity linked to the presence of chitosan, these aspects being of great importance for the application of these materials as reinforcement in biodegradable polymeric films.",

Five evaluation scenarios were considered: pessimistic, moderately pessimistic, neutral, moderately optimistic, and optimistic. For the cartographic visualization of accessibility, the interpolation of the results is carried out by means of the inverse distance weighting method, generating thematic maps for each evaluation scenario. The application of these methods provides an effective tool for the management and analysis of a great range of spatially referenced data in the decision making process.",

    "Abstract": "An analytical method that determines the short and long-term response of prestressed and non-prestressed concrete beam-columns reinforced with any combination of FRP bars or/and plates, steel rebars, bonded and/or unbonded prestressed tendons is proposed. Beams and columns encased with FRP fabrics and FRP tubes filled with concrete are covered with the proposed model. The effects of tension stiffening, creep and shrinkage of the concrete, and the relaxation of the prestressed steel reinforcement are considered. The models proposed by Vecchio and Collins [1] and by Popovics [2, 3] for the stress-strain relationships of the concrete in tension and compression are adopted, respectively. The strain-stress relationships of the steel and FRP reinforcements are modeled using multiple straight lines (polygonal lines). The method of the fibers (modified) is used to calculate the moment-curvature diagrams at different levels of the applied axial load (i.e., the M-P-\u03a6 curves), and the Gauss method of integration (for the sum of the contributions of the fibers parallel to the neutral axis) to calculate the lateral rotations and deflections along the span of the beam-column. The validity of the proposed model and corresponding equations were tested against experimental data available in the technical literature (see part II of this publication).",

    "Abstract": "A welding procedure (WPS) for MIL A46100 steel armor joints using the gas metal arc welding process (GMAW) was developed and qualified according to mechanical and non-destructive (NDT) requirements of military codes. Obtained results were compared to shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) procedures used to weld this type of steel. It was found that designed WPS is a suitable option to weld MIL A46100 armors according to the results obtained. In addition, a narrower heat affected zone (HAZ) was obtained with designed WPS which should lead to a better in-service armor performance according to results of previous studies. Finally, an increase in Charpy v-notch (CVN) test impact energy compared to the SMAW procedure was found.",

    "Abstract": "To date, no complete study of magnetotactic bacteria's (MTB) natural microcosms in estuarine or tropical environments has been reported. Besides, almost all the studies around magnetotactic bacteria have been based on fresh waters away from the Equator. In this work, we focused the experimental region at the Equator and present a comprehensive mineralogical and physicochemical characterization of two estuarine bacterial microcosms. The results show that mineral lixiviation in the sediments may be an important factor in the solubilization of elements required by magnetotactic bacteria. Specifically, we show that clinochlore, phlogopite, nontronite, and halloysite could be among the main minerals that lixiviate iron to the estuarine microcosms. We conclude that nitrate concentration in the water should not be as low as those that have been reported for other authors to achieve optimal bacteria growth. It is confirmed that magnetotactic bacteria do not need large amounts of dissolved iron to grow or to synthesize magnetosomes.",

    "Abstract": "The main objective of the research reported in this paper is to determine the response of a hot mix asphalt (HMA) in terms of both the tensile strength and energy parameters (based on the assessment of the force-displacement curve) as potential tools for improving the HMA mixture design. The HMAs analyzed were fabricated using a 60-70 penetration asphalt binder, dense-graded aggregate, mineral filler, and different types and contents of mineral filler replacements (i.e., lime, cement, and fly ash). The indirect tensile test was conducted to determine both the HMA tensile strength and force-displacement curve, which allowed for the computation of the HMA toughness as well as the energies involved in the process before and after reaching the tensile strength. Corresponding results suggest that the replacement of mineral filler by cement, lime, and fly ash modified the HMA response in terms of both the tensile strength and energy parameters. In addition, analysis of the energy parameters discussed proved to be useful for determining the optimum mineral filler content of HMA. Consequently, analysis of these energy parameters can benefit the HMA mixture design process.",

    "Abstract": "The design of the industrial facilities distribution is one of the most important decisions to be made, as it will condition the operation thereof. The concept of industrial installation as it is known today has evolved to the point that it integrates automation and information systems. Indeed, such evolution has given rise to the so-called intelligent factory. At present, in order to produce customized mass products according to customers' requirements, it is become an important issue the distribution of facilities with the generation of successful layout designs, based on the flexibility, modularity and easy configuration of production systems. This paper proposes a methodology to solve the problem of plant distribution design and redesign based upon a novel modular approach within an industry 4.0 context. Proposed methodology is an adaptation of the \"SLP\" Methodology (Systematic Layout Planning-Simulation) so-called SLP Modulary 4.0 (systematic planning of the Layout based on a modular vision under a context of Industry 4.0); this methodology incorporates in its structure an integrated design system (IDS) into its structure, which allows collaborative work with different CAD design and simulation tools. For the validation of the proposed methodology, a case study of a coffee processing plant is considered. The distribution design results obtained from the case study prove the benefit and usefulness of the proposed methodology. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Three different types of maltodextrin encapsulated dehydrated blackberry fruit powders were obtained using vibrofluidized bed drying (VF), spray drying (SD), vacuum drying (VD), and freeze drying (FD). Moisture equilibrium data of blackberry pulp powders with 18% maltodextrin were determined at 20, 30, 40, and 50\u00b0C using the static gravimetric method for the water activity range of 0.06-0.90. Experimental equilibrium moisture content data versus water activity were fit to the Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) model. Agreement was found between experimental and calculated values. The isosteric heat of sorption of water was determined using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation from the equilibrium data; isosteric heats of sorption were found to increase with increasing temperature and could be adjusted by an exponential relationship. For freeze dried, vibrofluidized, and vacuum dried pulp powder samples, the isosteric heats of sorption were lower (more negative) than those calculated for spray dried samples. The enthalpy-entropy compensation theory was applied to sorption isotherms and plots of \u0394H versus \u0394S provided the isokinetic temperatures, indicating an enthalpy-controlled sorption process.",

The response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to evaluate the effect of variables such as: catalyst concentration, herbicide concentration, pH, and the volumetric flow on the photocatalytic reaction in two kinds of photoreactors: flat plate and tubular reactor. The response variable was the pesticide mineralization expressed as the total organic carbon (TOC) removal percentage of the herbicide after four hours of irradiation. For the treatment carried out in the tubular reactor, the four effects had the same significance on the degradation; whereas for the flat plate reactor, the catalyst concentration and the pH were more significant. The results obtained suggest that the RSM is a suitable technique for obtaining optimal operating parameters of a photocatalytic process with a specific reactor and within a determined range of study.",

    "Abstract": "A method that determines the minimum bracing stiffness required by a multi-column elastic system to achieve non-sway buckling conditions is proposed. Equations that evaluate the required minimum stiffness of the lateral and torsional bracings and the corresponding \"braced\" critical buckling load for each column of the story level are derived using the modified stability functions. The following effects are included: 1) the types of end connections (rigid, semirigid, and simple); 2) the blueprint layout of the columns (i.e., the cross section orientation and location of the centroid of each column); 3) shear deformations along each column using the modified method initially proposed by Haringx in 1948; and 4) axial load distribution among the columns (i.e., load pattern). The effects of axial deformations and warping torsion are not included. The proposed method is applicable to 2D and 3D framed structures with rigid, semi-rigid, and simple connections. The formulation presented in this paper is based on a previous work presented by Aristizabal-Ochoa in 2007. It is shown that the minimum stiffness of lateral and torsional bracings required by a multi-column system depend on: 1) the blueprint layout of the columns; 2) the variation in heights and cross sectional properties among the columns; 3) the flexural and shear stiffness of each column; 4) the load pattern on the multi-column system; 5) the lack of symmetry (in the loading pattern, column layout, column sizes, and heights) that cause the combined torsion-sway buckling all of which reduce the buckling capacity of the frame as a whole; and 6) the support conditions and restraints at the top end of the columns. The proposed method is limited to multi-column systems with elastic and orthotropic columns with doubly symmetrical cross sections (i.e., with a shear center coinciding with the centroid) oriented in any direction with respect to the global axes. Four comprehensive examples are presented in detail in a companion paper that shows the effectiveness and simplicity of the proposed method.",

    "Abstract": "Chromium nitride (CrN) films have been applied to several steels as protective coatings against wear and corrosion due to their excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, and in the electronic field these films are commonly used due to their low electrical resistivity. However, it has been found that multilayers combining metal/ceramic films could enhance mechanical and electrical properties compared with their monolayer counterparts, due to the higher amount and interaction between interfaces. In this work, Cr/CrN nano-multilayers have been produced through the unbalanced magnetron sputtering technique with three different degrees of unbalance, in order to study the influence of this parameter on electrical properties. Cr/CrN multilayers with approximately 1 \u03bcm of total thickness and a bilayer period (\u039b) of 200 nm, 100 nm, and 20 nm were produced at room temperature on H13 steel and silicon (100); and their microstructure and electrical properties as a function of the magnetic field were evaluated. The phase formation was characterized through x-ray diffraction, and results presented (111) and (200) preferred orientations for all the multilayers. Cross section images were obtained through scanning electron microscopy and a multilayer structure can be clearly seen.",

For the implementation of this emulator, an appropriate mathematical model is chosen, parameterized, and experimentally validated.

Spatial distribution maps of noise were generated for the inside of each animal facility, using geostatistics technique through semivariogram analysis and interpolation by ordinary kriging. It concludes that the birds were, in general, subjected to noise levels above 62.0 dBA and during clean and disinfect (decontamination period) the sheds were at approximately 35.0 dBA. The spatial profile of the noise level to the productive environment provide for the attainment of more detailed information about the studied system. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this work was to characterize chemical, mineralogical, granulometric, plastic and thermally three clays, named \"Cascajo\" (C), \"Roja\" (R) and \"Amarilla\" (A), proceeding from Barichara, Santander. As well as, to obtain ceramic pastes suitable for the manufacture of bricks and roofing tiles. For which ceramic test pieces were made by pressing, which were sintered to 1050oC and later them were physical and mechanically characterized. The results demonstrated that the paste of clay \"Roja\", with water content between 24 and 38%, is the most adequate for the manufacture of roofing tiles; since the ceramics present low water absorption (8.2 %) and high rupture module (9.3 MPa). To obtain bricks it is recommended the paste with clays mixture of 55% \"Cascajo\" and 45% \"Amarilla\", with water content between 23 and 32%; so, ceramics with water absorption minor to 15 % and rupture module bigger than 5 MPa are obtained.",

    "Abstract": "The elastic mechanical behavior of elastic materials is modeled by a pair of independent constants (Young's modulus and Poisson's coefficient). A precise measurement for both constants is necessary in some applications, such as the quality control of mechanical elements and standard materials used for the calibration of some equipment. Ultrasonic techniques have been used because wave velocity depends on the elastic properties of the propagation medium. The ultrasonic test shows better repeatability and accuracy than the tensile and indentation test. In this work, the theoretical and experimental aspects related to the ultrasonic through-transmission technique for the characterization of elastic solids is presented. Furthermore, an amorphous material and some polycrystalline materials were tested. Results have shown an excellent repeatability and numerical errors that are less than 3% in high-purity samples.",

    "Abstract": "Biodiesel production from ricin oil has been the focus of several pieces of research in recent years. However, few studies related to the basic ethanolysis of this non-edible vegetable oil have been reported. In this work, the optimum conditions for maximizing the conversion of the basic ethanolysis of ricin oil were determined using the response surface methodology (RSM). Experiments were conducted using a 2k rotable central composite design. The process variables were evaluated at two levels: alcohol/oil molar ratio (3/1- 10/1), catalyst quantity (1%-1.5%), and temperature (20 \u00b0C-35 \u00b0C). In order to ensure a good adjustment of the design, a quadratic model was implemented for the response variable. The model was able to predict 99.663% of the total variation of the system. The optimum conversion was of 93.64%, obtained with an alcohol/oil molar ratio of 9.86/1, a catalyst concentration of 1.2% with respect to oil weight, and a reaction temperature of 30 \u00b0C, for a period of 1 hour.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper the power system voltage stability problem is analyzed with active power-voltage (PV) curves, as a voltage compensator is introduced. The PV curves' shape has been a subject of great concern, especially when voltage compensators are incorporated. Nevertheless, when such devices are taken into account, ordinarily the power electronic devices' commutation it is not considered in detail. This paper proposes a shunt connected voltage compensator model that gives careful consideration to commutation dynamics. Through load variations, simulations are carried out for building the PV curves. Additionally, the field over-current protection in generators is taken into account in order to evaluate its impact on the aforementioned curves. A single-phase equivalent shunt compensator, and the proposed model, is simulated in a small power system. Results are exhibited, which show particularities that arise due to the proposed model.",

    "Abstract": "The contact stabilization process has been applied in full-scale plants which treat domestic wastewater. The main advantage of this process is the short hydraulic retention time (HRT) in the contact reactor (CR), allowing treatment volumes significantly lower than in conventional activated sludge processes. This paper presents an analysis of the influence of the HRT and sludge recycle rate (r), on the performance of a contact stabilization process to remove organic matter and solids from the domestic wastewater of the city of Cali (Colombia). The research was carried out at Ca\u00f1averalejo Wastewater Treatment Plant (C-WWTP) facilities. The contact stabilization process was assessed at a pilot-scale unit treating raw wastewater influent to the C-WWTP. The HRT varied between 0.84 to 1.66 h in the contact reactor and 2.56 to 4.65 h in the stabilization reactor (SR). The evaluation of HRT was carried out with different r varying between 40 and 100%. The operational conditions that allowed for us to obtain the best performance in terms of organic load removal (14.05 kgCOD.d-1), with removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and total suspended solids (TSS) of 86, 87, and 82 %, respectively, were an HRT of 0.84 h in CR, and 4.11 h in SR, with a sludge recycle rate of 40%. In order to guarantee this performance, average values of sludge retention time (SRT) of 6 d; a volumetric organic load (VOL) of 2.13 kgBOD5.(m3.d) -1; a food microorganism relation (F/M) of 0.89 kgBOD5.(kgVSS.d)-1; and a mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) of 1125 mg.L-1 in CR, and 3173 mg.L-1 in SR, must be maintained.",

Its compact design allows minimizing disturbance to the flow field, resulting in more accurate results than other probes. Bubbling fluidized beds are widely used in petrochemical processes, metallurgical, and thermoelectric plants. The behavior of the bubble is one of the most important parameters for the simulation and design of thermoelectric reactors, as it relates to the jumping phase, the interaction between solid and gaseous phases of the bed, and the behavior of mass transfer. Knowing both the speed and the size of the bubble helps to characterize these systems, bringing about a better design of large-scale reactors.",

The governing equations were discretized and solved using the finite volume method on unstructured triangular meshes; and a coupling scheme for the fluid and solid heat transfer problems was proposed. The computational model was validated using two test cases in which local and average Nusselt numbers are reported in the literature. The local Nusselt number for each apple was obtained during one hour of air cooling as a function of the Reynolds number. Nusselt number and temperature distribution were found to vary in the apples due to the conjugate behavior of the problem. The conjugate approach showed itself to be a powerful tool for optimizing the convective heat transfer correlations reported in the literature.",

The main goal is to create a set of reusable software components for the rapid production of a software systems family. Many authors have proposed different approaches to design and implement the components of a product line. However, the construction and integration of these components continue to be a complex and time-consuming process. This paper introduces Fragment-oriented programming (FragOP), a framework to design and implement software product line domain components, and derive software products. FragOP is based on: (i) domain components, (ii) fragmentations points and (iii) fragments. FragOP was implemented in the VariaMos tool and using it we created a clothing stores software product line. We derived five different products, integrating automatically thousands of lines of code. On average, only three lines of code were manually modified; which provided preliminary evidence that using FragOP reduces manual intervention when integrating domain components. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The Zero Average Dynamics (ZAD) strategy has been reported in the last decade as an alternative for controlling power converters. This technique has the advantage of guaranteeing fixed frequency switching. However, the stability of the controller is highly dependent on the load value, and when the stability is lost, the fixed frequency switching is lost too. In this paper we generalize ZAD strategy using the probabilities framework through the expectation operator. Thus, we recover classical sliding mode control classical ZAD strategy, and new control methods can be defined, which are more stable than the others previously used. For this reason, this technique is entitled Generalized Zero Average Dynamics (GZAD). We will show several simulations regarding an application to a DC-DC Buck converter within the generalized ZAD strategy, which cannot be deduced from the classical ZAD. Numerical simulations show good regulation features and a wide range of stability.",

In particular, the proposed method represents bidding functions as points in a multidimensional space where a clustering algorithm is applied. Also, as a result of this method, a dramatic reduction over the search space of bidding strategies is achieved. In addition, some relations of dominance over bidding strategies are found, improving the pattern recognition process of agents' bidding behavior. This method is applied on the bidding prices database for some GENCOs of the Colombian power (electricity) market. Furthermore, an application of some data mining algorithms is presented with the purpose of quantifying some hypothesis formulated on the effect of hydrology over both spot and bidding prices.",

    "Abstract": "Thermoplastic starch (TPS) was obtained from natural and acetylated cassava starch using a twin screw extruder and then conditioned at 25\u00b0C and 54% of relative humidity. It was found that the crystallinity index, calculated as the ratio of the IR peaks at 1047 (crystalline phase) and 1022 cm-1 (amorphous phase), decreases due to the effect of a plasticization process. Also, as expected, SEM micrographs show that the plasticization process destroyed the starch granular structure almost completely and an amorphous mass was obtained. The TGA results indicated that the activation energy, Ea, was also reduced by the plasticization process. The acetylated TPS shows a decrease in Tg, in tensile strength and in the percentage of moisture absorption compared to natural TPS but a larger strain at the breaking point. This behavior suggests that the chemical modification reduces the secondary interactions between starch chains due to the substitution of the hydroxyl groups by acetates.",

    "Abstract": "Modeling with Non Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) surfaces has become a standard in CAD/CAM systems due to its stability, flexibility, and local modification properties. The advantage of fitting with NURBS surfaces is well known, but it is also known that NURBS surfaces have several deficiencies. A NURBS surface cannot be fitted over an unorganized and scattered set of points and the representation of sharp features like edges, corners, and high curvatures is poor. This paper presents a new method for fitting a NURBS surface over an unorganized and scattered cloud of points, preserving its sharp features. In contrast with other methods, ours does not need either to construct a network of NURBS patches or polygon meshes. By reducing the dimensionality of the point cloud using ISOMAP algorithms, our method detects both regions with lacking points, and regions where the cloud is too dense. Then, the cloud is regularized by inserting and removing points, and it is approximated by a NURBS surface. An evolutionary strategy obtains the weights of the NURBS surface in order to improve the representation of sharp features.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, the oxidative stress was produced by the illumination of either fi xed TiO2 or suspended TiO2, and the relation between cultivability and viability under oxidative conditions was studied using a Direct Viable Count (DVC) and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) methods. Under certain oxidative conditions simulating incomplete treatments, viable cells that had lost their cultivability were observed to recover all of their physiological functions when transferred to fresh nutrient media. Moreover, alterations in the nutrient assimilation processes were studied by 1H-NMR during and after the photocatalytic treatment. This allowed us to shed some light on how the damage chain propagates during the treatment. This work demonstrate that the Standard Plate Count (SPC) method commonly used to estimate the c ell populations during disinfection processes is ill adapted, whereas the FISH-DVC pair offers a reliable alternative.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, a failure analysis of the wheel shafts of wagons for transporting sugar cane is carried out. Several shafts have broken with a small fatigue propagation zone and a large sudden-fracture zone. The material and load condition of the shafts were examined. Stress measurements on a vehicle with a similar suspension system were conducted to fi nd the dynamic loads and calculate the impact factor. An impact factor higher than the one reported in the literature was found. According the manufactures, AISI 1045 steel was the material of the shaft; however, it was found that the material of some shafts did not have the specifi cations of AISI 1045 steel. Moreover, even if the shafts were made with good quality AISI 1045 steel, the stresses are so high that the element will fail due to fatigue. Finally, some recommendations are given to increase the reliability of the shafts, and a new design and manufacturing process are proposed.",

    "Abstract": "This paper conducts an empirical investigation on the temporal stability of parameters of freight demand models in the shortmedium term. The analyses are based on seven national freight origin-destination samples conducted by the Colombian government during the years 1999 to 2005. The paper studies the stability of the parameters of freight generation and freight distribution. Typical formulations of these models were calibrated using the cross-sectional data corresponding to each year. Then, to identify time-dependent effects, the resulting parameters were regressed as a function of a time index. The results indicate the presence of statistically significant time-dependent effects on all freight generation models (production and attraction), as well as on the freight distribution model estimated with loaded vehicle trips. In contrast, the parameters of the freight distribution models based on commodity flows were found to be stable overtime.",

    "Abstract": "Well testing is the cheapest and most accurate tool available to find the distance from a well to a linear constant-pressure boundary or fault. Several methods exist in the literature with which to determine this parameter. Most of them use conventional analysis and are only useful for isotropic reservoir systems. The few methods for anisotropic systems obtain the well-to-discontinuity distance through conventional analysis, type-curve matching and TDS technique, and then a correction by anisotropic effects is applied. In this work, a unified behavior of the pressure derivative was found, so the new shorter and most practical expressions used to find the distance from the well to the discontinuity, including the simultaneous effects of anisotropy angle and anisotropy index, are included. These new formulae were successfully tested with two synthetic examples and one field case example, and deviation errors higher than 30% are observed if an anisotropic system is treated as an isotropic one. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The pressure derivative for Bingham Non-Newtonian fluids is presented in the literature for the first time. The higher the minimum pressure gradient, the more asymmetrically concave the pressure derivative becomes. Also, it was observed in closed systems that the late unit-slope pressure derivative coincides with the same one for Newtonian fluids.",

    "Abstract": "Effective control of rougher flotation is important because a small increase in recovery results in a significant economic benefit. Although many flotation control strategies have been proposed and implemented over the years, none of them incorporate concentrate grade measurements at intermediate cells because these data are not usually available. On the other hand, there is much research on characterizing concentrate froth on the cell surface by image processing in order to extract information on froth color, bubble size, and speed that can then be used for developing expert control strategies, and some works have shown the possibility of estimating the concentrate grade. This work presents two multivariable model based predictive control (MPC) strategies for a rougher circuit. The first strategy is based only on general tailings and concentrate grade measurements while the second one includes, beside these data, the intermediate cell grade estimates. Both strategies are compared with a fixed control strategy. Simulation tests show that the recovery can increase by 1.7%, compared to the fixed control strategy.",

Unfortunately, conventional DWs offer little support for managing trajectories. Although there are some proposals that deal with trajectory DWs, none of them are devoted to conceptual multidimensional modeling.

The model being proposed consists of seven non-linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients that represent the main cellular and molecular populations in avian immune response. Values for the parameters were obtained from avian and mammalian literature. In silico-generated responses in terms of antibody concentrations are presented and compared to reported kinetics.",

Southern Spain (Autonomous Community of Andalusia, Malaga) offers industrial and tourist sites with highrisk devices and a large influx of people. The analysis of the degree of control and water disinfection is presented as a preventive indicator against the development of the biological agent, included in national legislation. Through a descriptive study and use of nonparametric tests, is concluded that regulation compliance is higher in the studied systems than in other facilities at risk. There are deficiencies in preventive maintenance of the devices water quality, so there is a serious risk to the exposed population.",

    "Abstract": "A study of water clarification process in industrial water treatment system using a polymerized inorganic coagulant (aluminum hydroxychloride) is made in this paper. Initially, the most important conceptual elements of the stages of clarification process (coagulation, flocculation and sedimentation) are established. Then, it identifies the major conventional coagulants used in water treatment and the polyaluminum chlorides (PAC's) are mentioned as part of a new generation of alternative coagulants whose use has increased in recent decades because of their better performance with respect to conventional coagulants; technical and operational aspects to be considered when implementing a water clarification process using a PAC as coagulant are specified. Finally, some comparative data of water clarification process real operating conditions, from a previous work, which replaced a conventional coagulant (aluminum sulfate) by aluminum hydroxychloride are presented and a better performance of the process after the replacement is proved.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this research was to assess the sensory acceptance and shelf life of a fresh cheese employing dry bromelain extract as a coagulating agent. Dry bromelain extract was used in three concentrations (5%, 10% and 15% w / w) and the milk utilized was both raw and pasteurized, for a total of six treatments being studied according to a factorial model 3 * 2. A sensorial analysis was conducted and the shelf life (sensorial, physicochemical and microbiological) of the treatment, with the greatest acceptance, was determined. The results showed that the cheeses obtained with the greatest sensorial acceptance were those made with 5% w / w of dry bromelain extract regardless of the type of milk used (raw or pasteurized). The shelf life of the selected product (T2), at the physicochemical level is 26 days; however, sensorially and microbiologically the quality of the product is good up to day 14. Therefore, the use of dry bromelain extract as a vegetable coagulant showed a great potential as a substitute for traditional rennet. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Interest in supplementation of fruit beverages with probiotic bacteria has been increased recently due to the demand to develop functional beverages without lactose. This presents a technological challenge since the low pH and storage temperatures of these beverages can affect bacterial viability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the viability of three commercial probiotic strains (L. paracasei, L. casei and L. rhamnosus) in a mango beverage stored at 4 \u00b0C. This research was carried out in three stages: assessment of the acid tolerance of each strain, selection of a prebiotic as a cellular protectant against environmental stress, and evaluation of physicochemical and sensory stabilities during storage. The most stable strain appeared to be L. casei, which was then evaluated with 5% FOS as a prebiotic substance for growth stimulation. During the final stage, it was found that L. casei produced significant changes in the pH and titratable acidity of the mango beverage after one week at 4 \u00b0C. The product was found to have good sensory acceptance to consumers. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The experimental and analytic characterization is presented of two nonconvectional and widely used configurations of the system, which were subjected to static and cyclic tests. Additionally, a mathematical model using finite elements was developed and calibrated with the experimental results. This study showed a good performance of the system, characterized for a proper stability and stiffness comparable to those obtained with a Swiss commercial fixator AO\u00ae in similar configurations. On the other hand, tests under cyclic loading showed the stability of three configurations during a simulated gait protocol. Thus, the use of the system is completely validated which is in agreement with its good behavior during former tests.",

Strong chemical interactions, associated with hydration and solvation phenomena of ions, as well as the Ohe model were considered. Shortrange interactions, like van der Waals forces, and longrange interactions involved in the Debye-H\u00fcckel equation were also considered. Empirical parameters were obtained for ethanolwaterpolyalcoholcalcium chloride and potassium acetate systems, these systems are important in industrial applications because the addition of polyalcohol and salt improves the efficiency of the separation. Measurements of the isobaric vaporliquid equilibrium were performed in an Othmer distiller. This thermodynamic model could be useful to design and simulate the extractive distillation water-ethanol.",

    "Abstract": "A process for hydrogen production through rice husk steam gasification is proposed and simulated. The gasification results in a gas composed mainly of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and steam, in addition to methane, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. The gas is fed to a shift reactor where carbon monoxide reacts with steam to produce more hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Later some of the carbon dioxide is captured as it reacts with hydrogen to produce methanol, resulting in a gas composed mainly of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methanol, and with lower amounts of nitrogen, methane and water. Methanol and water are separated by condensation from the noncondensable gases, which in turn are separated from hydrogen by pressure swing adsorption (PSA), that allows production of high purity hydrogen (97,5% molar) for fuel cell applications. For on-board storage purposes, hydrogen compression to 300 atm is included here.",

The methods used to establish the effect of the treatment are: Physicochemical characterization, water activity, solubility index, particle size, vitamin C and carotene content. The results confirm that the drying temperature of 45\u00b0C is suitable for the drying process of beepollen because the process time is lower and the physical, chemical and nutritional properties are not affected. The protein, fiber and ash contents are not affected by the drying temperature. The carotene content of the pollen from la Calera is higher than that of the pollen from Zipaquir\u00e1, probably due to the composition of the flora in each zone.

However, with dozens of new compounds generated each year, is impossible to establish protocols for industry and estimate its direct impact on ecosystems before its production in industry. Prediction of metabolic systems allow preliminary estimate the possible transformations that a complex compound may suffer as a result of their interaction with ecosystems, giving an indication of the biological treatment facility and your risk for the health of the environment. This work presents the biodegradation of three reference compounds in Fuller land contaminated with Dielectric, oils with the aim of estimating their biodegradability and possible toxic intermediates generation simulation. Its major transformations, as well as enzymes involved and possible microorganisms that promote these transformations were identified for each compound. It was found that contaminants can be biodegraded completely and that are not generated toxic intermediates of importance, which confirms the feasibility of the biological treatment for dielectric oils.",

    "Abstract": "The San Luis creek basin is a small experimental watershed located in the urban area of the city of Manizales. It is a typical mountain basin of the Colombian Andes, which has been instrumented since few years ago. In the basin have been installed four pluviometric stations and one gauge station, where the approximate area at the outlet is 1,0 km2. The temporal information is available at intervals of 5 minutes. This paper aims to estimate the time of concentration and the lag time of a small experimental basin, which is gauged and therefore can be extracted the time of concentration and the lag time from the recorded information in hydrographs and hyetographs. These values are compared with estimated values using empirical equations available in the hydrological literature. The main conclusion emphasizes that the empirical equation of the time of concentration that shows a better fit is the median value of all empirical equations. The equations of Kirpich, Passini, California, SCS and Ventura-Heras are more conservative for hydrological design because show lower time values and therefore faster hydrological responses. In terms of lag time, there is an approximate ratio of 0,6 over the average estimated time of concentration.",

The hybridization of these two techniques of optimization without restrictions was carried out with a topology that allows to optimize in each iteration the parameters of the algorithm PSO using the modified simplex method. Numerical experiments with this hybrid algorithm were carried out and applied to several of typical test functions to establish its effectiveness. The results obtained were compared with the simplex and the quadratic methods, which turned out to be very satisfactory since the point of view of their repeatability and reproducibility, although the time of computation was considerably longer. It stands out itself, nevertheless, that the precision of the hybrid algorithm was a hundred percent in all the trials for the test functions selected.",

Thirty-three IPE-140 steel beams with and without longitudinal stiffeners were tested under simple-support conditions with a laterally unbraced length ranging from 0.69 to 6.0 m. The stiffeners spacing was 0.42 m, which represented three times the depth of the section. The structural behavior of the beams is discussed in terms of their flexural capacity, the lateral displacement of the compression flange and the failure twist angle. The results showed that the use of longitudinal stiffeners increased the flexural capacity up to 82%, decreased the lateral displacement of the compression flange and the failure twist angle up to 72 and 90% respectively, with respect to the specimens without stiffeners. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

In this work the kinetic parameters (activation energy, reaction order and preexponential factor) that characterize the rice husk and clay decomposition processes were calculated by using the thermogravimetric analysis technique (TGA). In the testing, nitrogen and air atmospheres were used and the samples were subject to temperature ramps from room temperature to 800 \u00b0C, with a heat rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. In order to determine the kinetic parameters a method based in the linealized Arrhenius's equation was used. The solution was obtained with StatGraphics Plus 5.1 software. Rice husk results showed kinetic parameters and lifetime lower to those for the clay, explained by its high durability and degradation resistance.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper the corrosion resistance improvement of [TiN/AlTiN]n multilayer coatings with bilayers periods of 2, 6, 12 and 24, deposited by magnetron sputtering technique on AISI 1045 steel coating is presented. The electrochemical behavior was studied by Tafel polarization curves and impedance spectroscopy methods (EIS), under 3.5% NaCl + 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The corrosion resistance increased gradually based of the period increase of the multilayered, finding values of corrosion rate of 18,51 mpy for the substrate without coating and 1x10 6 mpy for the multilayer coatings with 24 bilayers. The electrochemical measurements evidences the positive effect of the period increase of [TiN /AlTiN]n multilayer coatings.",

    "Abstract": "T91 ferritic steel has been widely used in traditional power generation plants, boilers and nuclear power plants. However, its oxidation resistance is significantly reduced at temperatures above 600\u00b0C. This research focused on the application of pack cementation technique to aluminize a T91 steel and optimum conditions were identified to diffuse a coating with uniform thickness (300 microns) and free of porosities. The oxide layer grown after oxidation at 800\u00b0C in air was evaluated. Characterization of the coating and the oxide layer (Al2O2) was carried out by using SEM, EDX and mapping. The results show a good oxidation resistance of the aluminized T91 steel, owing to the growth of a continuous thin layer of alumina with an average thickness of 6 microns after 7 days oxidation.",

    "Abstract": "Froth flotation uses various organic and inorganic reagents to increase performance and selectivity of the flotation process. Froth flotation takes place mediated by tensioactive substances that are adsorbed on the air/water interface. Potential substitutes for the currently used frothers, organic wastes of animal origin, like biosolids are found. This study was to evaluate biosolids and humic acids as foaming agents in froth flotation by quantification of their tensioactive capabilities, foam-forming potential and foam stability. Biosolids was able to change the surface tension of a solution, creating and stabilizing foams. Dosages under 4 g L-1 of flotation reagents showed a better tensioactive effect using biosolids instead of conventional flotation reagents, type MIBC. For an effective use of these substances as frothers, it is recommended to consider a preconditioning stage. That stage will permit separating soluble and colloidal fractions that show a tensioactive effect. Further research will be needed in order to scale-up current laboratory assays to operational mining scales.",

    "Abstract": "The Ultramarine Blue pigment (UB) is a sodium polysulfide aluminosilicate that reacts with the tricalcium aluminate (C3A) of the white Portland cement in presence of water, generating considerable amounts of early ettringite and a lesser proportion of tobermorite. This early ettringite is presented in the form of non-oriented fibers improving the mechanical performance of mortars, and at the same time leaving little amounts of C3A available for the formation of delayed etringite. The durability of white Portland cement mortars substituted in 0%, 10% and 20% wt with Ultramarine Blue was evaluated in this research, through essays of capillary suction and evaluation of longitudinal change of mortars exposed to a sodium sulfate solution with a concentration of 5% (ASTM C1012). The results show a higher compressive strength and flexure, a significant reduction of expansion, and a reduction up to 800% of absorbed water in mortars with Ultramarine Blue, due to the formation of additional early ettringite and tobermorite, this phases by the electron scanning microscope (SEM) were observed.",

After the kinematic model is established, the optimization problem is formulated to be solved by using a genetic algorithm with real or continuous coding; thus, avoiding computation of highly complex derivatives. The relevance of this work lies on fact that an alternative method is offered to those dependent on angular parameters, where equations that model the mechanism, are complicated, even in the simplest mechanism. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "A kaolinitic clay of Santander was beneficiated in order to obtain a suitable raw material for the manufacture of silicoaluminous refractories. With the application of the metallurgical operations of wet screening, sedimentation and leaching it was pretended to eliminate the major quantity of quartz and iron. The separation process of the quartz through screening and sedimentation was not efficient, since this one presents a particle size very small, similar to that of the clayey species; the relation Si/Al was reduced only in 12% (from 1,52 to 1,35). Almost the totality of the iron of the clay (near 98%) was eliminated through the leaching to 90\u00b0C, with solution of oxalic acid 0,4 M, with which the whitening of the clay was achieved. Finally, it was determined that it is possible to obtain refractories with softening point of 1600\u00b0C from the beneficiated clay.",

    "Abstract": "The firstand secondorder stiffness and load matrices of an orthotropic Timoshenko beamcolumn of symmetric cross section with semirigid connections including the effects of end axial loads (tension or compression) and shear deformations along the member are derived in a classical manner. Both matrices can be used in the stability, firstand the secondorder elastic analyses of framed structures made of Timoshenko beamcolumns with rigid, semirigid and simple connections of symmetric cross sections. The \"modified\" stability approach based on Haringx's model described by Timoshenko and Gere (1961) is utilized in all matrices. The proposed stiffness matrices can also be used in the inelastic analysis of frames whose members suffer from flexural degradation or, on the contrary, stiffening at their end connections. The closedform secondorder stiffness matrix and load vector derived and presented in this paper find great applications in the stability and secondorder analyses of framed structures made of beamcolumns with relatively low shear stiffness such as orthotropic composite polymers (FRP or composites) and multilayer elastomeric bearings commonly used in seismic isolation of buildings. The effects of torsional warping along the members are not included. Analytical studies indicate that the buckling load and the stiffness of framed structures are reduced by the shear deformations along the members. In addition, the phenomenon of buckling under axial tension forces in members with relatively low shear stiffness is captured by the proposed equations. Tension buckling must not be ignored in the stability analysis of beamcolumns with shear stiffness GAs of the same order of magnitude as EI/h2. The validity of both matrices is verified against available solutions of stability analysis and nonlinear geometric elastic behavior of beamcolumn structures. Five examples are included that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and corresponding matrices.",

It was found that higher concentrations in the osmotic dehydration pretreatment occurred nondimensional moisture curves more pronounced. The drying rate was higher for apples pretreated compared with that of fresh product, distinguishing a short induction phase only in SAC, andin both types of treatment (OD + SAC) a second stage imperceptible speed anda clear third stage of decreasing drying rate I andII. The drying rate was modeled using the equations of Newton andPage. The best goodness of fit was obtained by Page model, follow by Newton andHendersonPabis. The two performed temperatures levels (55 \u00b0C y 65 \u00b0C) were significative, since the meaningful interaction with osmotic dehydration. The better process condition was DO 50\u00b0 Brix andSAC 65 \u00b0C.",

    "Abstract": "Planning of demand forecasting for perishable products is important for any type of industry that manufactures or distributes, especially if it has a seasonal behavior and a difficult to predict variability. This paper proposes a metaheuristic based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for the combination of forecasts of multiple products, based on three models: Mixed Linear Model (MLM), Bayesian Regression Model with Innovation (BRM) and Dynamic Linear Bayesian Model (BDLM), which are part of the proposed combination whose process is based on minimizing the Mean of Absolute percentage Error (SMAPE) indicator. It is found that the BDLM and BRM methodologies obtain good results on an individual basis, being better BRM, however, the ACO algorithm designed yields a better result, facilitating an adequate prediction of the demand of several products of a company in the meat buffer sector. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "this article describes the design, construction and experiments of a prototype capable to levitate when it is subject to a high d.c. voltage between its electrodes, 24 to 30kV. Although this phenomenon it is well known for more than one century, its cientific basis are not known yet and there is not available a mathematical model which explains its behavior when it is subject to changing experimental conditions such voltage, geometry, weight, relative humidity and temperature of its environment. Besides the replication of this exceptional phenomenum, several straightforward experiments were carried out to show some of its outstanding character\u00edstics. Because it needs a high voltage difference between its electrodes, it was proved that it works as a conventional electrostatic separator because it eliminated solid particles from a gas sample confinated in a container or flowing, with the advantage of low energy requirements. In the same way, at the operational conditions, it produces ozone in a controlled way. It seems due to the strong air ionization as observed in the well known corona effect.",

    "Abstract": "The micro-Raman spectroscopy and X-ray-diffraction (XRD) was used as analytical techniques in pristine and hybrid clay. It was determined that the water content of adsorption decreases with the insertion of surfactants and with the increase in the number of hydrophobic chains, where the basal spacing observed in the XRD is relatively invariant for this type of modified clays. We identified some vibrational modes for both the pristine clay and organoclay. The most important band of absorption is CH2, symmetrical (2846 cm -1) and asymmetrical (2886 cm-11), which are intense. Other hand, we identified other vibrational modes of the aromatic ring at 1001cm-1 and 1600cm-1 and the group of the chain aliphatic C-C in 1296 cm 1 between others. Furthermore, the band corresponding to the vibrational mode of the OH group in 3625 cm-1 is not affected by the type of modifying being used on the clay.",

A theoretical model based on the method of the complex functions to calculate the stresses in a timber joint is presented. Laboratory tests with nonreinforced and reinforced timber joints show that with the theoretical model it is possible to predict adequately the loadcarrying capacity of the joints.

    "Abstract": "The aim of this research is to study the influence of the magnetic field configuration on the plasma parameters and other TaN, TiN, NbN, ZrN and CrN coating properties produced by the Unbalanced Magnetron Sputtering system (UBM). This system allows modifying de ionic current density and the energy of the ions that arrive at the substrate, through the variation in the magnetic field configuration without modifying other deposition conditions. The different configurations of the magnetic field were quantified through the unbalance coefficient, KG, which is proportional to the position in the magnetron zero field. The most important effect of the increase of the ionic bombarding when varying the magnetic field configuration was observed on film microstructure, particularly on preferred orientation. [200] preferred orientation was observed in all coatings when using KG = 1.3 configuration. However, for KG = 0.85 the answer was different for each material. Another consequence of increasing ionic bombarding was the compressive residual stress increase which resulted higher for TaN films as CrN films presented the lower stress concentration. Higher hardness was observed for TaN, NbN and ZrN films, ZrN films had higher corrosion resistance, and NbN films presented higher wear resistance.",

    "Abstract": "One of the most common strategies in structural control is the installation of Tuned Mass Dampers (TMD). A TMD basically consists of a mass, a spring and a damper which are connected to the structure. Its frequency can be tuned to a particular value with the objective of making the damper absorb part of the input energy, decreasing the structural peak response caused by the dynamic load. The present paper analyzes numerically, with the help of the software ANSYS, the most efficient number and position of Tuned Mass Dampers attached to a metallic Gerber beam. TMD's properties are designed according to Den Hartog's and Jangid's expressions. The obtained results demonstrated reductions in the beam's dynamic maximum response above of 80% in the cases where the excitation was harmonic and above 45% in the case that the applied load in the beam was a random load white noise load.",

    "Abstract": "Biodiesel has become a technologic choice to decrease the fossil fuel consumption. Vegetal oils transesterification with methanol is the more used pathway, from the commercial viewpoint, due to the high conversion of triglycerides and the availability and price of alcohol. Methanol is generated essentially from a fossil fuel like methane; whereas bioethanol is renewable and because of this, its use would represent a better environmental option. The technoeconomic prefeasibility of the biodiesel production, by using bioethanol and palm oil like raw materials, was analyzed. Two processes (acid and alkaline catalysis) were studied by using the Aspen Plus\u2122 simulator software. The biodiesel was simulated by taking the ethyl oleate as the representative molecule, and the properties of the mixture were established by fitting the NRTL model from the experimental data of the liquid-liquid equilibrium. The process would become profitable by implementing the homogenous acid catalytic pathway (H2SO4) whenever the conversion is higher than 95%.",

In the preparation of the mixtures, was used the rheometric analysis to define the optimum temperature of the extrusion process, and a weight ratio of 80:20 PP: fillers was maintained, while for the injection molding process six generations of PP and its compounds were obtained to study the rheological, thermal, morphological and mechanical properties of the new series of PP n M composites formed from a recycled matrix and the PPM n series reprocessed compounds for up to six cycles. The results allowed correlating the changes due to the thermal history and the influence of adding the mineral fillers. The mechanical characterization in the reprocessed matrix indicated a 6.0% decrease in tensile strength and an increase in flexural strength of 9.9%. Likewise, the compounds showed an increase in tensile strength of 11.7%, while flexural strength reached 35.8%. From the thermogravimetric analysis, the degradation temperature in the matrix gradually decreased from 406.5 \u00b0C to 364.3 \u00b0C, for the sixth generation with respect to the virgin material by the injection process; meanwhile, for the compounds was maintained around 410 \u00b0C indicating an optimal interaction, these results could be contrasted with the colorimetric analysis. Finally, re-injection led to a significant decrease in the size of the talc and CaCO 3 particles; the sizes were estimated from microstructural analysis from Scanning Electron Microscope. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Motion detection in surveillance and monitoring systems is enhanced by the synergistic combination of different kinds of cameras and their optimal distribution over the area of interest. We developed an optimization model for a synergistic vision system based on integer lineal programming. The objectives consist in the following: on one hand computing the optimal position and orientation of all directional and omnidirectional cameras, in order to maximize the workspace coverage and on the other hand detecting the objects motion in the workspace. To detect efficiently the movement, even under global luminosity changes, is used a background subtraction algorithm, which uses spatial information of texture. The proposed method is evaluated using a representative set of real sceneries and a network of cameras. Outcomes show that our algorithm is able to determine also the minimal cameras network configuration required to cover a given area.",

    "Abstract": "The firstand secondorder stiffness and load matrices of an orthotropic Timoshenko beamcolumn of symmetric cross section with semirigid connections including the effects of end axial loads (tension or compression) and shear deformations along the member are derived in the first article. The \"modified\" stability approach based on Haringx's model described by Timoshenko and Gere (1961) is utilized in all matrices. Both matrices are used in the stability, firstand the secondorder elastic analyses of framed structures made of Timoshenko beamcolumns with rigid, semirigid and simple connections of symmetric cross sections in the five examples included in this article. Analytical studies indicate that the buckling load and the stiffness of framed structures are reduced by the shear deformations along the members. In addition, the phenomenon of buckling under axial tension forces in members with relatively low shear stiffness is captured by the proposed equations. Tension buckling must not be ignored in the stability analysis of beamcolumns with shear stiffness GAs of the same order of magnitude as EI/h2. The validity of both matrices is verified against available solutions of stability analysis and nonlinear geometric elastic behavior of beamcolumn structures. Five examples are included that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and corresponding matrices.",

Jobs are subject to release dates and there are sequencedependent machine setup times. Since this problem is known to be strongly NP-hard even for the single machine case, this paper proposes a heuristic algorithm to solve it. The algorithm uses a strategy of random generation of various execution sequences, and then selects the best of such schedules. Experiments are performed using randomgenerated data and show that the heuristic performs very well compared against the optimal solution and lower bounds, and requiring short computational time.",

Its origin comes from the mineralization of the organic matter, from the dissolution of sedimentary rocks and from the exchange with the gaseous nitrogen. An increase of organic matter from domestic, agricultural and industrial sources, raises the concentrations of nitrogen, that though it is an essential nutrient, in high concentrations generates harmful effects to the aquatic biota and therefore an ecosystem is unbalanced. In this article an analysis of the spatial variation of the forms of nitrogen: ammonia, nitrites and nitrates in the profile of the river Medellin is done, seeking to understand the phenomena associated with its transformations. In the same way, a temporary analysis from information gathered from the year 1973 of different physicochemical studies made in the river is done. Finally, the growth of population and the uses of the soil with the concentrations of nitrogen are correlated, trying to understand the concentration as a product of the interaction of the man with the nature and the processes of occupation of territory.",

Then the article exposes the factors used to set the price of gasoline in Colombia. Finally, it is concluded that the price of Colombian gasoline is very high and does not follow the equation proposed by the government and the factors that have the most influence on the final price are the producer income mainly affected by the WTI and the Market Representative Rate.",

The fluid was considered deep enough to allow the growth of a thermal boundary layer with no restrictions. The conservation of mass, momentum and energy equations at the solid and fluid were converted into a non dimensional form. The heated body presents a constant heat flux at the bottom side, and convective heat transfer at the top side. The interface temperature was obtained using the Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In order to verify the results obtained using the Chebyshev polynomial approximation, the results obtained from the analytical solution for the solid, were compared with the results attained with commercial CFD software, FIDAP\u00ae. The solution considered the calculation of the local and average heat transfer coefficient, the local and average Nusselt number, the local and average Biot number, and different temperature distributions at the interface.",

    "Abstract": "The generation expansion planning (GEP) problem consists in determining the type of technology, size, location and time at which new generation units must be integrated to the system, over a given planning horizon, to satisfy the forecasted energy demand. Over the past few years, due to an increasing awareness of environmental issues, different approaches to solve the GEP problem have included some sort of environmental policy, typically based on emission constraints. This paper presents a linear model in a dynamic version to solve the GEP problem. The main difference between the proposed model and most of the works presented in the specialized literature is the way the environmental policy is envisaged. Such policy includes: i) the taxation of CO2 emissions, ii) an annual Emissions Reduction Rate (ERR) in the overall system, and iii) the gradual retirement of old inefficient generation plants. The proposed model is applied in an 11region to design the most costeffective and sustainable 10technology US energy portfolio for the next 20 years.",

    "Abstract": "This paper's aim is to present the performance of a Bspline neural network controller to regulate the reactive power provision from synchronous machines. Due to the fact that power systems work with nonstationary parameters and changing settings, adaptive control schemes are preferred. Control technology must ensure its performance in terms of power system's operation to address the diversity of loads and the optimal utilization of the available resources. The Bspline neural network is an efficient tool to implement the adaptive control voltage, with the possibility of carrying out this task online taking into account the systems' nonlinearities. The reactive power dispatch is based on the premise that each machine must provide a proportion according to its nominal operating capacity. The applicability of the proposal is demonstrated by simulation on a 9buses 3machines power system.",

NiO nanoparticles were synthesized over a 7 nm silica support using the incipient wetness technique. Emulsified heavy oil (HO) with 40%v/v of water and 13\u00b0API was used to evaluate the ultrasound cavitation process over different exposure times and nanoparticle dosages. The viscosity of the emulsified HO before and after ultrasound cavitation was measured with and without nanoparticles. Significant viscosity reduction was obtained, showing best results at 90 minutes of ultrasound exposure time with a nanoparticle dosage of 2000 mg/L, leading to a viscosity reduction at 10 s -1 and 25\u00b0C, and an asphaltene content reduction of 44 and 16%, respectively. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Dental ceramics are the preferred materials for oral restoration due to some characteristics, such as adequate esthetics, high fracture strength and chemical stability. Currently, dental professionals have a large amount of ceramic systems to choose from, all of them having small differences regarding their chemistry, processing temperatures, mechanical strength and clinical applications. These differences lead to classification systems that are difficult to understand by professionals outside the dental field. The aim of this work is to review the current dental ceramic systems and present them from a compositional perspective to assure the comprehension of these materials by professionals who belong to the Biomedical Engineering field. A great effort was made to avoid classification methods imposed by manufacturers and to obtain a quick compilation of available information from the literature allowing the reader to have a general view of the stateoftheart on dental ceramics.",

    "Abstract": "In displacementbased design methods some demand considerations, starting from the first mode of vibration, are usually made. However, some authors have called the attention on the importance of taking the higher modes into account, due to their influence in the distribution and demand of both, moments and shears along the vertical elements, with significant effects. In this work, the method presented allows to consider, in a practical way, the effect of the higher modes on the seismic response of a structure. The proposal to achieve it, is a simplified model of Three Degree of Fredom developed from a mass concentration of four points equally distant along the building height. This method corresponds to an iterative process, in which the analysis and design procedures are carried out simultaneously, thus, avoiding considerations or suppositions on resistance and ductility values. This method has been applied to the structural walls of a 15storey building. The results obtained show the efficiency of the method in terms of the proposed objectives achievement and the fast converging of the iterative process involved. The effect of the higher modes is extremely noticeable in the distribution of shear stresses and the use of an initial pre-dimensioning involving the reinforcement, allows consistency between the analysis and the structural design.",

    "Abstract": "As a part of an overall effort to develop a new Alalloy appropriated for structural applications, a characterization research was directed towards the development of microstructure and their relationship with heat treatment. The AlMgSiZn was chose for that purpose due to the presence of precipitates in \u03b1-Al matrix and at grain boundaries, capable to get an excellent relationship between hardness and mechanical resistance. With regards to microstructure, this was characterized in the ascast and asaged condition. This treatment was carried out in two stages, the first one at 450\u00b0C during 3 hr which correspond to homogenization treatment and the second one, the ageing treatment at 160\u00b0C 1hr. Results of microstructure characterization in the ascast ingots showed the \u03b1-Al dendrites, and in addition the presence of a binary eutectic and particles of Mg7Zn3 type in interdendritic regions. The eutectic and particles were modified by the aged treatment. Transmission electron microscopic observations carried out in specimens with and without heat treatments showed a uniform distribution of precipitates with different morphologies like cubic, spherical and platelet; in the matrix, which were no detected during the scanning electron microscope observations.",

    "Abstract": "The compound parabolic collector (CPC) is a widely used technology in photochemical applications, like photocatalytic reactions. For kinetic purposes in this kind of reaction, the radiation distribution has to be well known, since the reaction rate is strongly dependent on the photon absorption rate. The present work develops a mathematical model which allows simulating the reflection of direct solar radiation on a CPC. Using analytical geometry and vector calculation, equations were evaluated, first for calculating the Cartesian coordinates of the reflecting surface. Later these points are used to calculate incident and reflected rays layouts on the collector. Visual Basic (Excel environment) program was developed for data generation and plotting the reflected rays at any instant. The incident radiation on the receptor was plotted separately displaying the daily direct energy distribution in the absorber. Also the involute length (collector) was calculated with these data, which can be very useful information for collector construction. Results obtained after simulations show that the distribution of incident energy on the absorber surface depends on the surface reflectivity. The incident energy is larger at the top of the absorber than the bottom zone and it is more convenient higher surface reflectivities for more uniform energy distributions. This mathematical model can be a first approach for absorption models which include direct solar radiation in photochemical or photothermal applications.",

Several alternative estimators have been proposed. Among them, estimators based on the minimum volume ellipsoid (MVE) and the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) are powerful in detecting a reasonable number of outliers. In this paper we propose a T 2 control chart using the biweight S estimators for the location and dispersion parameters when monitoring multivariate individual observations. Simulation studies show that this method outperforms the T 2 control chart based on MVE estimators for a small number of observations.",

Samples were produced by the standard solid state reaction method. Rietveldlike refinement of xray diffraction data permit to establish the crystalline appropriated distribution of rare earth and yttrium to create substantial planar weight disparity (PWD) in alternating layers. DC resistivity measurements reveal the improvement of the critical temperature (Tc) when substitution of exact 5050 mix of rare earth (Sm, Gd, Dy, Ho, Eu, Yb) and Yttrium is performed. A bulk Tc/ \u2248 94.3 K was determined by the criterion of the maximum in the temperature derivative of electrical resistivity for the analyzed samples. The correlations of the critical exponents with the dimensionality of the fluctuation system for each Gaussian regime were performed by using the AslamazovLarkin theory.

    "Abstract": "This article builds and evaluates a business sustainability model for a manufacturing industry in which indicators of sustainable development are incorporated. The construction and analysis of the model is based on the system dynamics methodology. This methodology begins with the characterization of business sustainability and its indicators, models and applied methodologies are then reviewed, the production process of the analyzed company described, and the model is finally elaborated integrating the environmental, economic and social dimensions. The simulations of the model showed that the inventory of finished products accumulates over time and that the incorporation of energy saving technology is one that has a more effective impact on consumption, and the proportion of waste generated grows as the production order\u2019s size increases. Finally, it is concluded that the designed model is useful for the evaluation of strategies and the definition of sustainability actions. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The influence of the soil resistivity and the fault resistance is considered in this paper where a comparison of a well defined impedance based method for locating faults is presented. Tests were performed in a real power distribution system, using soil resistivity measurements and a range of fault resistances commonly found in such systems. According to the results in a 34kV power distribution system, it is notice that the soil resistivity models which best represents the real systems are those which give better results in the fault location. Additionally, the higher the fault resistance is, the lower the performance index is, showing the influence of this variable. Finally, the influence of the soil resistivity in the distance estimation in such faults where the zero sequence current is different from zero is also analyzed in this paper.",

X ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the chemical composition by observing the behaviour of the Ti2p, N1s and C1s lines. Binding energy analysis confirmed TiN and TiC formation. The C1s and Ti2p peaks shifted with increasing XPS sputtering time, thus revealing hydrocarbides contamination. Furthermore, depth profiles of the TiN/TiC bilayers showed that the films grown at a substrate temperature of 150\u00b0C had a thicker TiN layer than the samples grown at 50\u00b0C. Nitrogen had diffused into the TiC layer and carbon into the TiN layer in both films.",

This insecticide is included in the Stockholm Convention, signed and ratified by Colombian government in 2008, and it is considered one of the most harmful humanmade compounds. For this model contaminant a complete metabolic biodegradation sequence was built and a simulationbased strategy was formulated for its biodegradation in a practical case. According to the simulated metabolic pathway, a sequential aerobicanaerobicaerobic reactor would be the best choice to achieve complete biodegradation. Using these results, the authors propose an innovative system for the biological treatment of POPs; this system was called BioReactive Permeable Barrier (BioBarrier).

    "Abstract": "Normally, in a heterogeneous formation, the transition period of flow from fissures to matrix takes place during the radial flow regime. However, depending upon the value of the interporosity flow parameter, this transition period can show up before or after the radial flow regime. An accurate understanding of how the reservoir produces and the magnitude of producible reserves can lead to competent decisions and adequate reservoir management. So far, no methodology for interpretation of pressure tests under the above mentioned conditions has been presented. Currently, an interpretation study can only be achieved by nonlinear regression analysis (simulation) which is obviously related to nonunique solutions. Therefore, in this paper, a detailed analysis of pressure and pressure derivative behavior for a vertical well in an elongated closed heterogeneous formation is presented. We studied independently each flow regime, especially the duallinear flow regime since it is the most characteristic \"fingerprint\" of these systems' new equations to characterize such reservoirs is introduced and were successfully verified by interpreting both field and synthetic pressure tests for oil reservoirs.",

The development of a production plan involves the determination of parameters that often have some degree of vagueness, it is concluded that the personnel in charge of taking dedication assume the management of this uncertainty. Fuzzy logic appears as an alternative to traditional or stochastic processes to assist decision making in fuzzy environments. This article begins with a brief introduction of the production planning and fuzzy logic. In the second part it designs a fuzzy linear programming model as a tool to support decision making in the aggregate production planning when it follows a strategy of forecast demand, assuming the claim as a fuzzy parameter. For the construction of this model previously was to raise a linear programming model to mark the boundaries of the fuzzy model. Finally in this paper solves an aggregate planning problem where demand is uncertain, using the proposed fuzzy model.",

    "Abstract": "The use of mobile devices inside vehicles while driving is generating an imminent safety risk. Due to this situation, one of the most relevant solutions is the Head-Up Display (HUD) system, which displays information about the system, status, and aids of the vehicle and a little data of the in-vehicle entertainment in the driver\u2019s field of view during the driving activity. In fact, it is important to establish some guidelines or parameters to design HUD interfaces, since the automakers do not disclose their guidelines for the overall design of these interfaces. The main approach of this article is to propose a methodology for the design of automotive HUD interfaces, considering information from the ADAS, IVIS and external devices that meet the current needs of drivers. A validation of the methodology was made with product design engineers and computer engineers. It was concluded that predominantly in the designs the classification of information depending on the level of importance is clear. In this case, driving information is the most relevant in the whole design. An important aspect concerning the implementation of HUD devices is that this technology has more relevance in automotive interior design looking for a perfect balance between the primary task, driving, and the secondary task, multitasking activities on nomadic devices. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Tommy Atkins) cubes were evaluated during the processes of osmotic dehydration with or without vacuum pulse (DOPV and DO) in combination with hot air (SAC) or vacuum (VAC) drying: Observing that DOPV and SAC are the most effective methods since they require less process time to reach its adequate moisture levels for a better consumption and conservation; after obtaining the times for each treatment, physicochemical analysis of pH, tritable acidity, humidity, aw, \u00b0Brix, color and texture were carried out to the fruit, and it was found that the DOPV reduces the acidity of the samples and fruits treated by DOPVVAC and DOVAC presented greater variations in their color and more hardness. The analysis concluded that the best combined method is DOPVSAC, since this requires less time to process and possesses acceptable values in the physical and chemical parameters.",

    "Abstract": "A UCT modified hybrid system composed by an anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic chambers connected in series, was operated at laboratory scale. Biomass growth in the system was promoted both in suspension and adhered onto small granular plastic particles. The granular particles were maintained in suspension in the aerobic chamber. During the operation the Hydraulic Retention Time was varied from 18 to 10 hours. Solids Retention Time was 15 d. Two different synthetic wastewaters (medium I and II) with a similar composition than urban wastewater, were fed to the system. The reactor was operated to promote the removal of C, N and P in the wastewaters. The system was operated continuously during 150 days. From operating day 1 till 86, the residual wastewater was prepared by diluting a peptone mixture and meat extract (medium I). From day 87 on, medium II was used, and a mixture of sodium acetate and acetic acid were used as carbon source. The results obtained have show a high removal efficiency of both COD and N of 90% and 85%, respectively. With regard to P removal, best results were obtained when the system was fed with medium II, achieving P efficiencies above 95%. The use of the plastic support particles made feasible the development of nitrifying biofilm. This improved the stability of the system against the disturbances that took place in the reactor.",

Hardness values of these coatings were between 15 and 24 GPa, being the hardest values in the samples with carbon content in the 3953% range. A correlation has been found between carbon content and friction coefficient values which are in the 0,70 to 0,15 range, obtaining these last values for coatings with carbon excess. Wear behavior under dry sliding tests showed also a marked dependence with carbon content. The best results of wear were obtained for the highest carbon content coatings.",

    "Abstract": "Many industrial processes are multivariate in nature since the quality of a product depends on more than one variable. The multivariate control of processes captures the relation between the variables associated with the process, if this correlation is ignored and univariate control charts are used for every variable separately is possible to conclude erroneously over the process status. In the continuous case, many researches have been done, however there are few works that aim to correlated attributes. In this work we compare three charts of control for correlated bivariate binomial random variables, which are associated with attributes. The charts are: Hotelling's chart based on the approximation of the distribution binomial multivariate to the normal multivariate distribution. MNP chart which is an extension of univariate np chart, and chart that is a nonparametric methodology based on the Mahalanobis's depth. The comparison is made through of simulation study using as a comparison measure the average run length (ARL). In this work we present an example of the used methodologies to construct control charts for bivariate binomial variables in a telecommunications company. The results shown in general terms that the MNP chart is the best in both control and out of control.",

Model results show oscillations in the profiles of density and potential, and the separation and reversal of the charge in the EDL. Additionally, the model shows a prevalence effect of ions size over the asymmetric charge effect, producing a positive potential of zero charge (PZC) for the studied system, although the adsorption of the hydrating atmosphere of anions is more favorable than that of cations.

    "Abstract": "The development of materials capable to satisfy the requirements of a bone substitute is a great scientific and technological challenge from the point of view of biocompatibility as much as the porous microstructure control that promotes osteointegration and improves the implant mechanical performance. In this work, the preparation of macroporous materials through the repeated use of the infiltration technique with ceramic suspensions is presented. The obtained materials were characterized by X ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water absorption measurements and compressive strength tests. It was found that commercial polyurethane foam infiltration with mixed alumina and zircon suspensions allows the Insitu transformation of zirconia into a matrix with similar porosity to the original foam. The matrix infiltrated with hydroxyapatite showed pore diameters of 300 mm and an average compressive strength of 5,44 \u00b1 0,94 MPa, both characteristics are typical of a well bone substitute.",

    "Abstract": "Niobium Nitride (NbN) and Aluminum Niobium Nitride (AlNbN) thin films were deposited on silicon (100) and steel AISI 4140 substrates through a multitarget r.f. (13.56 MHz) magnetron sputtering system. The target where made using 4N purity Nb and Al and the growth was performed under a gas mixture of Ar/N2, for different substrate polarization voltages, in order to study the effect of polarization voltage on the crystalline structure and electrochemical properties. Steel 4140 is widely used for fabrication of machines components with hardness between 28 and 38 Rockwell C, however life time of this steel is limited by its low wear and corrosion resistance. The XRD pattern of the sample showed predominantly Bragg peaks for the planes (200) corresponding to FCC phase of the AlNbN, hexagonal\u03b4' NbN phase and hexagonal AlN phase. The FTIR analysis showed vibrational modes associated with NbN, AlN and AlNbN bounds. The steel AISI 4140 with and without AlNbN coating were characterized through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization curves. As a result of this work it was found a voltage polarization dependence on speed corrosion for NbN and Al-Nb-N films.",

Four treatments were tested: polished surface, corrosive atmosphere (sugar cane juice), low quality roughness (typical equivalent surface of the shaft cane mill) and the combined condition of the two last treatments. Fatigue tests were performed in rotating bending conditions and the values of fatigue strength for the different treatments were obtained. The decrease in fatigue strength due to the rough surface treatment was 1.53%, due to the corrosive environment was 14.9% and due to the high roughness and corrosive environment was 16.1%.

The methacrylic monomer is adsorbed by the silica and subsequently polymerized by means of thermal treatment using benzoyl peroxide as initiator. The adsorbed weight percentage is determined using ultraviolet spectroscopy and its conversion to PMMA is followed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The decreasing in the surface area and the pore diameters, besides the absence of a glasstransition temperature, confirm that macromolecules are occluded into the channels of the silica. The insertion of the polymer inside the mesoporous structure, creates an interpenetrate organicinorganic network, turning this molecular compound into a potential strengthening for polymeric matrices based on methacrylates.",

    "Abstract": "Those coatings used as thermal barriers are designed to protect materials exposed to high temperatures, typically consist of a ceramic top layer, which normally is made of zirconia (ZrO2). The study of the microstructure in coatings produced by thermal spray is always a necessary and intermediate step in processing and achieving excellent properties for a particular application. For this reason, the objective of the work was to analyze the microstructure and the phases found in zirconiaalumina coatings produced by flame spray. The results show that for short time in the flame, rapid solidification and interdiffusion zirconia alumina of the ceramic powder during the coating formation induces two types of lamellas in its top layer: one is constituted by lamellas with different gray shades caused by small variations in the composition of tetragonal zirconia and amorphous alumina in solid solution, and the other structure consists for lamellas with a granular morphology constituted by monoclinic zirconia precipitated in an alumina matrix.",

    "Abstract": "The integration of renewable energy sources to create microgrids is drawing growing interest to address current energy-related challenges around the globe. Nevertheless, microgrids must be analyzed using specialized tools that allow to conduct operation, technical and economic studies. In that regard, this paper presents a case study in which the software HOMER Energy Pro was implemented to design and analyze the performance of a microgrid. Such microgrid comprises a photovoltaic system, a wind system and a diesel plant. The parameters of the energy systems are based on information about local weather conditions available in databases. Finally, this analysis is performed under two conditions: stand-alone and grid-tied. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In order to study the morphology and composition of magnetosomes synthesized by two magnetococcus found at La Fe Dam and Calima Lake- Colombia, magnetotactic bacteria (MTBs) were separated by magnetic induction. MTBs and their magnetosomes were evaluated by energy dispersive xray spectroscopy (EDX) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the size and shape of the nanocrystals were determined. Results revealed a high similarity between the magnetococcus under study, showing magnetite crystals with hexagonalprismatic morphology and average length of 83 and 87 nm for crystals from La Fe and Calima respectively. By the size and shape factor, crystals were classified in the single domain magnetic range. Results obtained allow seeing future applications for biogenic magnetite in biotechnology and medicine.",

A multiobjective and flexible approach, based in possibilistic dynamic programming, is proposed, recognizing, for each optimization criteria, the existence of non stocastic in certainties. The resulting cost is not externally defined and depends only on the structure model representation of system; then it's designed as intrinsic cost. The strategy proposed has been developed to defines the location and optimal number of sectionalizing devices. The proposed model is compared with a classic method supported in deterministic dynamic programming, applied on the same real system, and the advantages for the possibilistic approach are evidenced.",

    "Abstract": "It was studied the mineral distribution of two Colombian coals using a cyclone separation and oxidation at low temperature, OLT. The cyclone separation was carried out at two densities (1.3 and 1.4), three particle size (1000+600\u03bcm, 600+425\u03bcm and 425+250\u03bcm) and two processing stages. To determine the mineral matter, feed and underflow fractions from hydrocyclone were concentrated in mineral matter by OLT in a fluidized bed (T<300\u00b0C). 18 minerals were identified by X Ray Diffraction, XRD. XRD results showed 13 minerals from Golondrinas and 15 minerals from Guachinte coal. It was found that kaolinite and quartz were the most abundant minerals in coal fractions from Golondrinas and Guachinte. Furthermore, it was found that mainly minerals kaolinite, quartz, dolomite, jarosite, gypsum and pyrite, exhibited affinity towards mineral matter, while siderite and valerite showed affinity towards organic matter.",

    "Abstract": "The fluid flow simulation in porous media has been used in oil industry to characterize the reservoir. However, the analysis has been carried out with conventional assumptions that must be taken back in reservoirs with complexities that were not considered before. At present it has been found that those reservoirs are not as ideal as was thought and petrophysical properties change with stress; this is the basis of fluid flow coupled to geomechanics. The fluid flow equation is for a naturally fractured reservoir with single fluid and coupled with the equations of deformation. These are solved by using finite differences technique and a Picard type iterative method. The result is a numerical simulator for well tests interpretation taking into account the permeability changes with stress by using the permeability module.",

    "Abstract": "In this article, a fault detection and diagnosis method is developed for nonlinear systems described by multimodels approach. The main contribution consists in the detection, isolation and estimation of faults for the nonlinear systems using a faulted coupled adaptive filter. Based on the assumption that the dynamic behavior of the process is described by a multimodel approach around different operating points, a set of residuals is established in order to generate weighting functions robust to faults. These robust weighting functions are directly linked to the adaptive filter effectiveness which provides multiple fault magnitude estimations for the whole operating range of the system. Stability conditions of the adaptive filter are studied and its performance is tested using a three tank hydraulic system.",

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, there is a trend for industry reorganization in geographically dispersed systems, carried out of their activities with autonomy. These systems must maintain coordinated relationship among themselves in order to assure an expected performance of the overall system. Thus, a manufacturing system is proposed, based on \"web services\" to assure an effective orchestration of services in order to produce final products. In addition, it considers special functions, such as teleoperation and remote monitoring, users' online request, among others. Considering the proposed system as discrete event system (DES), techniques derived from Petri nets (PN), including the Production Flow Schema (PFS), can be used in a PFS/PN approach for modeling. The system is approached in different levels of abstraction: a conceptual model which is obtained by applying the PFS technique and a functional model which is obtained by applying PN. Finally, a particular example of the proposed system is presented.",

    "Abstract": "Making an accurate estimate of quality distribution in a granite deposit is essential, both from a financial point of view, to determine the profitability of the site, and from an environmental perspective, to focus operations on the most profitable areas thereby reducing the ext0065nt of land affected by such work. Granite is extracted in blocks whose profitability and value depend on the final size of the slabs, which is an important factor in defining quality. This article uses a variant of disjunctive kriging in order to determine the quality of granite in one of the largest reserves in the world-the Porri\u00f1o deposit located in northwest Spain. This method, unlike classical disjunctive kriging, considers random variables that are not necessarily binary. The advantage of using this technique compared to the classical statistical cokriging technique is that all the qualities are considered as variables with the same importance and that the sum of quality percentages in a block is one hundred percent. The validity of the method was tested in a crossvalidation process. The results compared favourably with those obtained using ordinary cokriging and fuzzy kriging.",

Corporate commitment is an essential condition for integrating sustainability, but is not sufficient. Another key condition is a business culture where sustainability is a high professional and business value and sustainability objectives are implemented through commitment rather than compliance. Furthermore, the integration process requires of an organizational structure specific roles and integration mechanisms and adequate management systems. In this paper, I would like to focus on the very complex management task for the integration of sustainability down to the operational levels of mining companies, the organizational structures and the management roles and systems required for integration.",

    "Abstract": "Times the main objective of this work is to define an industrial protocol to recover dense minerals present in the alluvial quaternary terraces of the Mi\u00f1o River (NW Spain), rich in a finegrained and highdensity material identified as black sands. The recovery and sale of these sands implies the complete utilization of the resource; thereby the sustainability of the exploitation is enhanced and the environmental costs are reduced. These black sands comprise two fractions of interest: a coarsegrained fraction, rich in gold, and a finegrained fraction rich in monazite, ilmenite, zircon, garnets, rutile, andalucite and xenotime. On this second fraction, the methods to characterize the mineral grade from the chemical and mineralogical points of view were defined and the procedures to concentrate and recover these dense minerals were also established. As a result, the combination of dry techniques of separation with magnetic and electrostatic devices to treat the primary concentrate previously obtained from wet gravity concentration allowed the highest grade of the minerals of interest to be obtained.",

    "Abstract": "The presence of sulphides in many mine wastes and the formation of acid mine drainages (AMD) has been widely recognized as one of the great environmental problems nowadays. Waters from many of the abandoned mines, with thousands of cubic meters of residue scattered in dumps and ponds, are affected by this type of pollution characterized by its acidity, high contents of sulphates and heavy metals such as Fe, Mn, Al, Cu, Ni, Cd. This study was designed to study the effect of use flying ash coming from Power Stations as a neutralizer for acidic waters resulting from this type of abandoned facilities. In this study, and due to the heterogeneity of the contaminants present, we have studied the removal of Ni, Cu and Cd. Different parameters were studied: metal concentration and pH of the solution to be treated, time reaction and pulp density. Fly ash can be used as a neutralization/fixation agent. Fly ash will add alkalinity and increase the pH on contacting AMD. This will result in precipitation of metal hydroxides.",

    "Abstract": "The abandoned San Quint\u00edn mining group (Ciudad Real) was operated by the Sociedad Minero Metal\u00fargica de Pe\u00f1arroya, and 515.300 tons of galena concentrates were obtained between 1888 and 1923. Two geophysical surveys, using electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) and groundpenetrating radar, as well as mineralogical and geochemical techniques have been used in order to obtain a geoenvironmental characterization of the mine pond. The ERI has allowed us to determine both the general geometry of the pond's substrate and a maximum thickness of the mine tailings of 12 m. Tailings are mediumtocoarse grained materials mainly composed of quartz, clay minerals, gypsum and feldspars. Neither acid mine drainage nor modification of their internal structure have been detected. The amount of ore minerals in the tailings have been greatly reduced because of their reworking. Joint application of geophysical and geochemical techniques has revealed as very useful for obtaining a complete characterization of abandoned mine deposits, previously to a future reclamation of these hazardous tailings.",

Furthermore a software application that calculates the corresponding planar profiles is developed.

    "Abstract": "The present work aimed to verify the efficiency of the chemical treatment on preventing drippers clogging, by applying treated sanitary sewarage. A platform for tests was built for this experiment, in order to supply four units of drip irrigation with treated sanitary sewarage, which was filtered in 120 mesh disc filter. Three different models of drippers were tested (M1, M2 e M3) for a period of 560 hours. In the chemical treatment, the concentrations of free residual chlorine of 0; 0.4; 1.0 and 1.9 mg L-1 were tested. The results obtained led to the following conclusions: the treated sanitary sewarage applied via the drip irrigation system produced a biofilm, which resulted from the interaction between the colonies of bacteria and algae in the drippers. The application of chlorine in the treated sanitary sewarage hindered the development of the biofilm inside the drippers and the lateral lines; and drippers with a longer labyrinth and more than one secondary filter (M2 e M3) are more likely to face obstruction when they receive treated sanitary sewarage. The concentration of free residual chlorine of 0.4 mg L-1 was more maintainable in the clogging prevention for biofilm in drip irrigation system operate with treated sanitary sewerage.",

    "Abstract": "Toxic effects of extractants and carriers of specific microorganisms must be taken into account before using them with hybrid fermentation processes that are combined with liquid membranes or liquid-liquid extraction. In the current research three extractants (trioctylamine, tri-iso-octylamine and Aliquat 336), three diluents (dodecane, dodecanol, and oleyl alcohol) and two mixtures (extractant/diluent) were tested for molecular toxicity on the bacteria Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 as potential components of a liquid membrane or a liquid-liquid extraction process for lactic acid removal in an intensified fermentation process. Glucose consumption, lactic acid production, and cell growth were used as toxicity indicators. Physical properties of extractants and diluents were related to the molecular toxicity on the microorganism. These results show that mixtures of tri-iso-octylamine/dodecane and trioctylamine/dodecane at a proportion of 1:9 v/v have great potential to be used in liquid membranes or liquid-liquid extraction processes on hybrid fermentations with Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

In the north of Cauca department, there are several anaerobic filters for wastewater treatment which have shown deficiencies associated with environmental and operational factors. The evaluation of start-up and the performance of full-scale anaerobic filter evidenced the need to adjust chemically the wastewater with a minimum dose of 2180 mg NaHCO3/L and the Buffer Index (BI) was shown as a simple and efficient tool for process control since allowed to determine instability conditions when its value was higher than 0,35. In stable conditions (TRHtheoretical 12 hours; TRHreal 10,2 hours), with chemical adjusting and BI inside the appropriate range (0,20 -0,30), the reactor reached COD and TSS removal efficiencies more than 77 and 76% respectively.",

Well test interpretation constitutes a key tool to obtain specific parameters in hydrocarbon reservoirs and it is the subject of this work. In the last decades it has been carried out studies that consider the change in rock properties due to the changes of pressure for the different activities. Having this in mind a software is developed that allows well tests interpretation and it can be used for different scenarios. The problem presents the diffusivity equation of monophasic flow of gas or petroleum in naturally fractured reservoir and it considers the pressure sensitivity with the permeability module.

    "Abstract": "In the present work the production and yield of fructose syrups were studied at laboratory level based on glucose syrups obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis of starches extracted from two cassava varieties C. Orense and C. M Tai-8. For the development of the work, an experimental design of multiple categorical factor totally at random was implemented considering two factors, the factor substrate concentration in five levels (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50% p/v of starch concentration) and the factor cassava varieties in two levels with three replicates, in a total of 30 experimental units. Glucose syrups were initially obtained by means of the enzymatic hydrolysis of the starch using the enzymes Termamyl 120 L in the liquefaction stage and AMG 300L for sacharification the stage, supplied by Novo Nordisk. Dextrose equivalent (DE) degrees of 95.32% and 94.12% were reached for C. Orense and C. M Tai -8 respectively to the starch concentration of 30%. The obtained glucose syrups underwent an isomerization process for a period of 15 hours in a fixed bed reactor with 10 g of the enzyme glucose immobilized isomeraze Sweetzyme IT of Novozymes to transform the glucose into fructose. Percentages of conversion of 71.4% were obtained for C. Orense of 74.93% for C. M Tai-8 respectively for the starch concentration of 30% p/v. The obtained syrups presented concentrations of fructose as high as 21.2% p/p for the variety C. Orense and 22.1% for variety M Tai-8 being classified as syrups of the second generation. According to the statistical analysis of the experimental data, statistical differences at a significance level of 5% were found between fructose yields for different cassava varieties and for different starch concentrations for the same variety. Maximum yields of 635.86 Kg of fructose/ton of starch and 674.71 Kg of fructose/ton of starch were obtained for C. Orense C. M Tai-8, respectively, considering an initial starch concentration of 30% p/v.",

This indicator aims to offer a comparative framework of the organizational efficiency of a company, having as references, on the one hand, the environment where the activities of the company are developed and, on the other, a virtual competitor achieved by the optimization of the resources of the initial sample of data of our study. The model estimates that the best adjusted production function for this kind of companies comprises the number of employees, not only technical but also administrative, as explicative variables. Furthermore, taking into consideration the initial data, the companies that display better ratios of organizational efficiency have 90% of technical personnel, approximately, regarding the total number of employees of the company, and an annual turnover around 100.000 Euros per technician.",

    "Abstract": "It is expected that in future years humanitarian missions for Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) clearance will be conducted to secure safe transit of people and goods, particularly in Colombian rural areas. Among the technologies that help humanitarian demining missions, laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has the potential to identify explosives and the materials used in the manufacture of IED casings. In this work a laboratory LIBS system was used to identify and characterize five polymers used in IED casing: polyvinyl chloride, high density polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene and polypropylene. Identification using lineal correlation was possible when polymer spectra were compared with spectra libraries of other samples and at least five single shot spectra were averaged in a spectral window centered at 255 nm.",

On the other hand, the Ni2+-Sn4+ mixture also decreased the coercivity rapidly (diminution ~ 75%) however without enhancing the saturation magnetization. The shown differences on magnetic properties were mainly due to both magnetic nature of divalent ion and secondary phase presence.

    "Abstract": "Multiscale analysis and computation is a rapidly evolving area of research that have had a fundamental impact on computational science and applied mathematics and have influenced the way we view the relation between mathematics and science. Even though multiscale problems have been longly studied in mathematics, such techniques suffer of the ill-posedness nature of the problem. In the solution of several ill-posed problems, discrete mollification has been used for regularization. In this paper, we propose a new technique (procedure) for multiscale analysis by using discrete mollification. The multiscale scheme is based on numerical linear algebra results combined with the mollification method applied to the Mallat algorithm. The new technique has a simple theory, an efficient implementation and compares fairly well with classical wavelet transform procedures. An application on electrocardiographic signals contaminated with typical non-white noise is considered.",

    "Abstract": "Differences in the chemical nature between petroleum diesel fuels and vegetable oils-based fuels lead to differences in their physical properties affecting the combustion process inside the engine. In this work a detailed combustion diagnosis was applied to a turbocharged automotive diesel engine operating with neat palm oil biodiesel (POB), No. 2 diesel fuel and their blends at 20 and 50% POB by volume (B20 and B50 respectively). To isolate the fuel effect, tests were executed at constant power output without carrying out any modification of the engine or its fuel injection system. As the POB content in the blend increased, there was a slight reduction in the fuel/air equivalence ratio from 0.39 (B0) to 0.37 (B100), an advance of injection timing and of start of combustion. Additionally, brake thermal efficiency, combustion duration, maximum mean temperature, temperature at exhaust valve opening and exhaust gas efficiency decreased; while the peak pressure, exergy destruction rate and specific fuel consumption increased. With diesel fuel and the blends B20 and B50 the same combustion stages were noticed. However, as a consequence of the differences pointed out, the thermal history of the process was affected. The diffusion combustion stage became larger with POB content. For B100 no premixed stage was observed.",

A response surface analysis using a second order model has shown that the concentration ratio has a significant influence on the carbon dioxide removal process. The model has been statistically validated (analysis of variance) and explained 98.41% of the variability of the CO2 concentration (v/v) change in the simulated biogas.

This paper compares stress on the lower back when using the conventional tool and a new cutting system for cutting bunches. The biomechanical analysis is carried out using simulations generated by JACK Siemens software. The study found a 95.97% reduction of intradiscal compression (L4/L5) when cutting bunches and showed that pressure on all joints was reduced, in certain cases, such as the back and elbow, by up to 100%. That is, when cutting using the new system, the worker maintains a neutral posture of the spine. The new design comprises a point of support on which the tool rests and means that workers only have to direct the blade. Future studies should compare both tools in terms of productivity while preserving the ergonomic characteristics. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "A new set of slope-deflection equations for Timoshenko beam-columns of symmetrical cross section with semi-rigid connections that include the combined effects of shear and bending deformations, and second-order axial load effects is developed in a classical manner. The proposed method that also includes the effects the shear component of the applied axial forces (Haringx Model) has the following advantages: 1) it can be utilized in the stability and second-order analysis of framed structures made up of Timoshenko beam-columns with rigid, semi- rigid, and simple end connections; 2) the effects of semi-rigid connections are condensed into the slope-deflection equations for tension or compression axial loads without introducing additional degrees of freedom and equations; 3) it is more accurate than any other method available and capable of capturing the phenomena of buckling under axial tension forces; and 3) it is powerful, practical, versatile and easy to teach. Analytical studies indicate that shear deformations increase the lateral deflections and reduce the critical axial loads of framed structures made of members with low shear stiffness.",

After that, the software allows to determine peak characteristics such as intensity, FWHM (Full With at Half Maximum), continuous and the line profile. These parameters were employed together with spectroscopic methods such as Boltzmann plot, different ionization degree line to line ratio and line to continuous ratio in order to determine Texc= 4778.32 K, ne=2.54 1017 cm-3 y Te= 2668 K respectively.

These macroscopic changes are related to changes in the microstructure of concrete. In this paper, the microstructure of thermally damaged concrete from real-scale reinforced concrete columns was studied, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). Two real-scale reinforced concrete columns, with different concrete mixtures, were exposed to ISO 834 fire standard curve for 4 hours. After heating, concrete core samples were drilled, sectioned and analyzed in different column section depths. Core samples from reference column not exposed to high temperatures, were also obtained. Macroscopic observations showed a change in the color of concrete exposed to high temperatures. SEM micrographs presented distinct changes in morphology, like coarsening, and the presence of cracks and voids. XRD diagrams showed a reduction of portlandite and presence of larnite as depth increases. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, the behavior of an AISI 410 martensitic stainless steel under corrosion-erosion conditions is evaluated. Quenched and tempered samples were used for the wear test, using a low velocity jet-like device connected to a potentiostat. Potentiodynamic polarization curves were obtained with the electrolyte in static state, with flow conditions and under corrosion-erosion, adding quartz particles to the electrolyte. In addition, mass loss measurements under erosion and corrosion-erosion conditions were carried out. The topography of the surfaces was examined after the wear tests, using optical and scanning electron microscopy. This information, together with the results of mass losses and the electrochemical tests were used to establish the degradation mechanisms of the stainless steels under different testing conditions. The results showed that synergism is a significant part of the degradation process of this steel (66.5%) and that the mass removal process of steel was controlled by corrosion assisted by erosion.",

    "Abstract": "Deep foundations are widely used for structures - bridges, dams, docks and buildings - located at sites with poor soil conditions at shallow depth. Due to the extensive use of deep foundations, the need has arisen for evaluating the structural integrity of these types of foundations posterior to their installation. A variety of non-destructive testing methods have been proposed and implemented for assessing the condition of deep foundations, but the PIT (pile integrity test) remains one of the more popular methods due to its relatively low cost and the short time involved in conducting such a test. This article describes some of the general aspects of the PIT and a specific application of this test on eleven piles at a construction site near the city of Palmira, Colombia. Structural problems were identified in two of the eleven piles and posterior excavations of these two piles proved the effectiveness of the PIT for assessing the structural integrity of deep foundations.",

    "Abstract": "Simulation studies, when used in several areas of investigation, are quite useful to study the behavior of some phenomena in which different virtual situations are generated by the researcher using some specialized software. Robustness studies are rather common in statistic research; many of them are used to observe the behavior of an estimator under several hypothetical situations that could happen in practice. Due to the similarity among the studies of simulation and the experimental studies, the aim of this work is to propose the use of both the methodology and the design and analysis of experiments in the studies of simulation. As an example it is presented a simulation study called \"Robustness of a three-state Markov model under different distributional specifications of the transition times\" that was completed under the approach of the experimental design and using the analysis of variance and multiple regression model in order to prove the effect of the sample size, maximum number of visits and the type of distribution of the transition times on the estimation of the parameters in a three-state Markov model.",

It was found that the ultramarine blue pigment to come in touch with the C3A of cement and water, allows the formation of large quantities of primary ettringite (disordered and dispersed in the matrix), thank to its sulphur content.

Likewise, descriptive statistics and experimental designs for interpretation of the results were also performed. The results showed that Hawthorn yam has the highest WAI (15.15 g gel/g sample, at 90\u00b0C). While WSI was similar for all species, SP is dependent on the temperature with values of 16.10 g gel/g sample (Purple yam and Hawthorn yam), and 11.25 g gel/g sample at 90\u00b0C (Diamante 22-type yam).

    "Abstract": "Air quality in animal confinements is directly related to animal metabolisms, releasing heat, humidity and carbon dioxide (CO2) to the air from respiration and gases from digestion and feces such as NH3, CH4, H2S and dust. Heating systems produce CO and NO2 due to incomplete combustion which produces concentrations greater than those allowed by Colombian legislation (Decreto 948, 1995), and international countries such as the USA (National Organization for Security and Health NIOSH, 1994) and Brazil (NR-15, 1978), which represent some of the largest livestock development industries in the world. Among these gases, ammonia is the pollutant most often found in air inside animal confinements which deteriorates the health and productivity of animals and people. Hence, the study of ammonia has attracted the attention of researchers for years in various different countries. The objective of this work was to discover important aspects which must be taken into account in animal confinements, such as permissible ammonia concentrations. The developed models calculate concentrations and emissions, which can be used in countries such as in Colombia, where works and knowledge on environmental control and the production of gases in livestock confinements are few.",

The role of the Natural Park of Sintra-Cascais (PNSC) in LUCC dynamics is evaluated. Results show that, inside PNSC, present LUCC depends on the immediate past land use and land cover following a Markovian behavior. Outside PNSC, LUCC change is random and does not follow a Markovian process. Estimates of LUCC for year 2006 are presented for the area inside the PNSC. These results reinforce the role of the PNSC as an indispensable tool for preserving LUCC stability and to guarantee its functions.",

    "Abstract": "This paper shows the results for the evaluation of the performance of an articulated bus prototype fueled with compressed natural gas (CNG). The results will be used to establish the technical viability of the fleet implementation in the massive transport systems of the biggest Colombian cities. In order to carry out the evaluation, some SAE recommended practices were modified to set with this kind of bus. The objective of the present work is to show the results of the comparative study of costs between two articulated buses that operate with different fuels: compressed natural gas (CNG) and diesel. The results will be used to establish the economic viability of fleet implementation in the massive transport systems of the biggest Colombian cities. The projection was made following the operation and maintenance recommendations given by the buses manufacturers, a life expectancy of 10 years, a total of 6250 km of road trip by month and two different scenarios for fuel price evolution. Three important costs were considered: engine and indispensable, fuel and preventive maintenance. The capital costs and fixed costs (like employee salaries, parking, taxes, and insurances) were assumed to be equal for the two types of buses. The results shows that the operation and maintenance costs have a similar behavior between both technologies, although preventive maintenance costs are smaller for the bus fueled with natural gas, situation that changes when the engine and indispensable costs are reviewed. Nevertheless it is important to write down that the greater influence on the operation and maintenance costs falls into the time behavior of the fuel price.",

    "Abstract": "Modeling problems involving bivariate dependent data is very important in many areas, such as finance, actuary, reliability and survival analysis. In the literature, some copula models have been widely used to modelling dependent multivariate distributions, among which stands out the Archimedean copula class. This paper presents a methodology to select from some Archimedean copula models the one that fits the best to a dependent dataset, using goodness-of-fit plots, Q-Q plots and Cram\u00e9r-von Mises goodness-of-fit test. We illustrated the methodology using simulated data and data from insurance claims. The results showed that the data insurance fits to a bivariate model based on the so called Frank's copula with lognormal marginals.",

At the beginning of the morning, winds inside valley were weak and followed The direction of topography, so that they had almost 90\u00b0 difference in comparison with above wind direction (blowing from east). Some hours later, as the radiation and the vertical turbulence processes began, inner valley winds were strongly affected by the presence of free-atmosphere winds so they appeared to be perfectly coupled with outer circulation.

    "Abstract": "A mathematical model has been developed for describing the effect of pulse current wave forms on size and hardness of electroplated nanocrystals. The model relates in a direct form the typical wave variables (frequency, duty cycle and peak current) with harness of generated deposits by means of direct current and by four pulse current wave forms: rectangular, ramp up, ramp down and triangular. The results of the model were evaluated for duty cycles of 20 and 80%, with frequencies of 50 and 150 Hz and peak currents of 4 and 8 kA/m2.The model predicts that small increases in the concentration overpotential drives to increase the nucleation rate significantly, diminishing the growth of the nanocrystals and generating a hardness increase. The increase of the duty cycle and the wave's frequency produces a behavior increasingly close to that produced by direct current, with a diminution in the nanocrystals hardness. Any modification in the waveform variables that increases the peak current produces higher hardness values.",

    "Abstract": "The articular cartilage is a poroelastic biological material that allows the distribution of mechanical loads and the joint movements. As a biphasic material, in presence of load, the articular cartilage deforms its solid matrix and modifies the fluid hydrostatic pressure inside. The aim of this work is to implement numerically a mathematical model that predicts the mechanical behaviour of articular cartilage taking into account the duality between the solid matrix and articular liquid, and its poroelastic feature. Using a finite element method approach, the response of a piece of articular cartilage in one and two dimensions has been simulated, with tensile, compresive and oscillative mechanical loads. The analysis of results allows a qualitatively validation of the poroelastic behavior of the model due to the solid matrix deformation and the fluid outflow that causes variations of pressures inside the articular cartilage according with reported trials. We conclude that the mathematical model allows the prediction of the articular cartilage biomechanical behaviour. Our results contribute to the investigative processes in fields of study like biomechanics and tissue engineering.",

Such model uses as input data the streamflows historical series but it also considers an exogenous variable for classes determination. This variable is the SST which is related, not just statistical but physically with the streamflows. As an example, the development of the model for three specific rivers of Colombian system is presented in a long term horizon, using the NOAA's SST medium term forecast.",

    "Abstract": "Conservation efforts aimed at preserving forest resources in the High-Andean P\u00e1ramo System of the Antioquia Department is part of a decision-making process fundamentally determined by allocation of financial resources. In this article I attempt to define a methodology to tackle this problem by undertaking a multiobjective analysis. Firstly, I propose specific criteria for analyzing spatial phenomena according to both field observations and Social Science theory. Subsequently I study correlation of such criteria in order to define the two objectives for analysis. Results suggest that correlation coefficients equal or greater than 0.6 are acceptable to represent the studied social phenomena. The methodology here proposed requires understanding the actual social phenomena under scrutiny within a flexible theoretical framework and to select analysis criteria that takes into account its statistical behaviour as a whole.",

    "Abstract": "This report concerns a data acquisition system with the final idea of measuring the cutting force in the threading process done on a conventional lathe. Analytical models are used to find the depth of cut of the machining tool. This is important because the machining force can be responsible for the tool collapse by plastic edge deformation. The cutting force was obtained through direct measurements in selected samples. This allows obtaining more realistic data compared with data obtained by analytical estimation from theory. The data acquisition system was implemented in LabView\u00ae, and it allowed analyzing the several variables involved in the machining process on conventional lathes. In such a way, it is possible to find out, in real time, the depth of cut variable. Specifically, the authors present results obtained from analysis of Fredericks, Sandvik and Lira models. This analysis allows drawing conclusions about the cutting force from each model. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The morphological analysis of verbs in the Spanish language is a difficult task due to the fact that they present special features. One of these features is related to the big amount of conjugation forms of a verb, and this fact makes difficult the automatic generation of these conjugations. Currently, there are proposals of verb analyzers, which make lemmatization and conjugation of verbs, but they still exhibit some problems. In this article, we propose a template-based morphological analyzer with the purpose of generalizing verb conjugations. The templates aim to make the conjugation and lemmatization processes without the need of independently saving all possible conjugation forms of a verb. The morphological analyzer was implemented in the programming language Python, to take advantage of the capabilities of this language for string manipulation.",

    "Abstract": "The Finite Element Method is used worldwide as a tool for analyzing the dynamic behaviour of structural systems. However, it is well known that finite element model predictions differ from experimental results obtained from vibration tests carried out on the structures being modelled. The area known in English as Model Updating, or Ajuste de Modelos, as it is called in this document, emerged as a response to the above problem and aims at executing parametric corrections on finite element models in order to make the analytical dynamic properties come closer to their experimental counterparts. This discipline has grown steadily during the last twenty years, although its diffusion in the Latin-American and Colombian context has been poor. This article presents a review of the state of the art at the time of its publication. It is hoped that this work will motivate research on the subject of Model Updating in places different from those where developments in this area have concentrated, and that it will provide sufficient information for Latin-American industries to include this technology in their practice.",

    "Abstract": "It was studied the lactic acid (LA) production by simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation of coffee mucilage with Lactobacillus bulgaricus NRRL-B548 in 500 ml vessels with 400 ml of medium, stirred at 110 rpm. The pH of medium was manually controlled between 5.6 and 6.0 by addition of NaOH 5M each 2 hours. Temperature was maintained at 45\u00b0C. The inoculum volume was 10% of the work volume. In order to optimize the LA productivity (P) three values of inoculum concentration (5, 10 and 15 g/l) and three initial concentrations of total reduction sugars (TRS) (27, 35 and 60 g/l) were tested. The maximal final concentration of LA was 41 g/l, obtained with an inoculum of 10 g/l and initial concentration of TRS of 60 g/l. The maximal productivity was 1.44 g/l-h, after 25 hours of fermentation, and it was obtained with an inoculum of 10 g/l and initial concentration of TRS of 60 g/l. At these same conditions it was obtained the maximal productivity at the end of the process (30 h) of 1.39 g/l-h. The maximal yield coefficient (YPS), calculated at 30 h of fermentation, was 1.67 g/g, corresponding to an inoculum of 15 g/l and initial concentration of TRS of 60 g/l.",

The experiment was designed as a three level factorial statistical model. The main objective was to assess the effect of these parameters on cumulative passing percentage (CPP) and surface area, both of which affect the quality of commercial cement. Physico-chemical properties, composition, mineralogy and granulometric distribution were determined using X Ray Fluorescence, Surface Area Analysis and Sieving Granulometric Analysis. Results showed that that CPP through a 325 mesh increases considerably with mill spin speed, that the rate of CPP increase decreases with residence time and that grinding media load changes were not significant. The surface area increased mainly as a function of increases in mill spin speed, while residence time and grinding media load had lesser impacts.",

    "Abstract": "Goal diagram has been used for a variety of purposes. First, it links stakeholder requirements and expectations to the organizational goals. Second, it establishes actor responsibilities. Third, it permits to explain the importance of the future software to the stakeholders. There are several works in goal diagram specification or use, and they exhibit some problems: goal diagram is commonly made by analysts in a subjective manner (objectives are identified from stakeholder information), objectives are often confused with operations, some works use a small sets of verbs, and sometimes objectives are obtained from scenarios (as a contrast, scenarios are obtained in a more advanced phase of software life cycle than objectives). We made, in this paper, the characterization of goal verbs from the so-called Lexical Conceptual Structures, the thematic roles, and a special linguistic classification of verbs. This process serves as a starting point for automatic obtaining of goal diagram. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm for extracting goal verbs from a computational lexicon.",

It was designed and tuning using information acquired from a rigorous simulation of an existing plant. It was found that the MPC strategy improves the heater performance. From the simulations it was observed that the controlled variables were within the operational limits. The implementation of MPC increased also the heater efficiency, its operation was more stable, it was possible to increase the amount of oil heated, and the mean life time of the tubes was longer.",

One of the most relevant variables in EPS component operation is temperature, because its real time monitoring allows predicting the state of the system and generating predictive maintenance actions that guarantee quality and continuity in its service. The modeling of the dielectric capsule is divided in two fundamental parts: i) a mechanical analysis using the finite element method for establishing the capsule response to vibrations in the regime reported in literature for generators and power transformers; ii) a thermal analysis using an analytical model that allows to establish the sensor's response speed due to temperature changes. The results that were found show a great potential on the material proposed for the fabrication of the capsule, which is not reported in this kind of applications.",

    "Abstract": "In order to carry out the alignment of non-rigid models a general transformation is required, which includes a rigid transformation and a deformation. In this work, we present a system that uses Radial Basis Functions to obtain the non-rigid transformation. Although modeling deformable objects using these functions is not a physical modeling, it is computationally faster compared with the methods based on physics like the mass-spring systems and the finite element analysis. This last one is used like a reference, since it allows approximating the deformation with high accuracy. A comparison is done between the deformation obtained with the different radial basis functions used: Gaussian, multiquadrics and inverse multiquadrics, and that one obtained through finite element analysis. The system is evaluated on four synthetic models.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this work has been to evaluate by comparison, the characteristics of Mn and Ni ferrites that have been obtained starting of their basic oxides by via mechanosynthesis. The process was carried out to room temperature, in vacuum; like milling means steel spheres of 3 mm of diameter and cylindrical bottles of 50 cm3 of capacity of the same material; relation in weight of ball/dusts of 10:1. The maximum time of the process was of 12 hours. They were evaluated by XRD, AAS, FTIR, SEM and magnetic permeability and distribution and sizes of particles. The obtaining of this ferrites by via mecanos\u00edntesis is effective but not from greater purities or homogeneities than the obtained by hydrochemical way. The most efficient time of the process it oscillates between the 7-10 hours of milling, slightly smaller for the manganese ferrite. Greater molar fraction is obtained (0,90) in the manganese ferrite in relation to the one of nickel; they were not significantly homogenous.

    "Abstract": "In response to increasing consumer demand for high-quality, easy-to-prepare foods, it is necessary to develop innovative ways to use roots and tubers, such as sweet potatoes, in processed foods. Thus, two thermal processes were evaluated, freezing-cooking (F+C) and blanching-freezing-cooking (B+F+C) on the physical properties of the orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) cultivar, which has a high content of \u03b2-carotene, in terms of drip loss (\u0394m), volume variation (\u0394V), color, and texture. Cylindrical samples of OFSP were used. Blanched and unblanched samples were stored by freezing, at-18 \u00b0C for 2 months, and subsequently cooked at 95 \u00b0C. The blanching process was carried out at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min. The results showed that, when blanching was used as a pre-treatment for freezing-cooking, a product with fewer physical changes, with a lighter and more intense color (chroma), and with a lower loss of elasticity (Ed) and firmness (F) was obtained. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

In order to solve the shape problem a paste was made. This paste was prepared using two different size particles (180 \u03bcm y 7 \u03bcm) with a relation of 70/30 weight, respectively. The SiC particles were agglomerated by a watery solution of 7,5% weight of celullose Type B plasticizer developed at laboratory. 15 ml of watery solution for each 100 grams of SiC were used.

The aim is to establish the relationship between the set of parameters that define the presence of spatial-temporal patterns in the solution of a reaction-diffusion system. These parameters are validated in 1D and 2D by the implementation through the finite element method of two well-known biological models: the Schnakenberg model and the glycolysis model. The results show that the parameters obtained by the mathematical analysis lead to the formation of spatial-temporal patterns.

Cement was chemistry tested by fluorescence of X-ray, and physical properties according to CS. Pigment and cement were tested in chromatic parameters by spectrophotometer through CIELAB system. Some additives and admixtures were selected (among organic, inorganic and mineral) to be added to the blue cement in a ranging of weight of cement. Samples of blue cement without additives but also those samples with different dosages of additives in the selected range were tested in physical and chromatic properties for different ages (1, 3, 7 and 28 days) when specimens were immersed in water saturated with lime. Additional to this, chromatic properties to some specimens at the laboratory conditions were tested at the same ages of time. Blue color completely disappeared with all organic additives and partially disappeared in some inorganic additives and mineral admixtures. Setting time, compressive strength and others characteristic of cement were affected, in some cases positive and in others negative, like effect of the different quantities of additives and admixtures added to the blue cement.",

    "Abstract": "A chemical kinetic study of the biomass devolatilization process is presented looking for to improve the design of the biomass gasification-combustion systems and their kinetics (dimensional) models. The study is carried out by means of thermogravimetric tests, with biomass size between 2 - 19 mm, and with the heating rate of 10, 15 and 20 K/min. This work is developed because there are not available results on the literature with biomass size bigger than 1 mm. The experimental points are fitted by means of a first order model, to calculate the parameters of the kinetic constants (Arrhenius form). The activation energy is proportional to the heating rate and the biomass size. It can be seen that the thermal decomposition of the biomass is gotten at higher temperatures; due to the transports phenomena (heat and mass) are more relevant. The kinetic parameters calculated can be used in the biomass gasificationcombustion dimensional models, in function of the biomass size, to improve the simulation results.",

    "Abstract": "Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) is widely used to measure soil water content. However, the effects of soil composition on FDR calibration have to be quantified to reduce the need for further calibration. Our objectives were to: (1) evaluate the accuracy of EC-5 for measuring water content in sandy soils, and (2) develop a soil-specific sensor calibration curve. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected in one Spodosol profile (07\u00ba 37\u2019 30\u201d S, 34\u00ba 57\u2019 30\u201d W) representative of the region where sugarcane is grown in northeastern Brazil. Regression analysis showed good accuracy and low error (RMSE = 0.01 m 3 m -3 ), while without specific calibration the error was higher (RMSE = 0.06 m 3 m -3 ). The EC-5 sensor should be subjected to field-specific calibration in sandy soils due to the low field capacity and water content during the growing season. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

These vibrations are determined by the dynamic parameters (mass, stiffness and damping), and is modifying these structural characteristics what reduces the response of the structure. The reduction of the structural response is the objective in the earthquake engineering an seismic design, guaranteeing a suitable strength, stiffness and ductility. In the past years have been purposed several alternatives to diminish the structural vulnerability, among them active, passive, hybrid and semi-active control systems which have been implemented in flexible structures (skyscrapers and suspension bridges) in Japan and the United States. This paper includes a brief historical summary of the development of these structural control systems and presents the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice of this technology. In addition, describes the limitations and advantages of the systems in the context of the structural seismic design and rehabilitation.",

The primary objective of computing the pressure derivative with respect to the radial flow time function is to simplify and facilitate the identification of radial flow and the characteristic trough of a naturally fractured reservoir. The proposed method does not require apriori the value of reservoir pressure. Only one log-log plot is used to determine the reservoir permeability, average pressure, storativity ratio, and interporosity flow coefficient. The main conclusion of this study is that small mini-fracture treatments can be used as an effective tool to identify the presence of natural fractures and determine reservoir properties.",

    "Abstract": "A methodology to define the damage resulting from a given seismic level in masonry buildings using simulated vulnerability functions is presented in this work. The proposed methodology consists in utilizing a vulnerability index correlating it to a damage index in function of a given seismic event. The vulnerability index model corresponds to the model reported formerly by Maldonado et al., 2007. The damage index was determined by a demand/capacity ratio, evaluating the stress using the Abrams' Model. The function design process required the utilization of a wide sample of buildings. Simulation techniques allowed the running of simulation in 6000 hypothetical buildings. For each hypothetical building its vulnerability index and its damage index was calculated for different maximum acceleration values, ranging from 0,05 g to 0,25 g. Probability of seismic damage vulnerability and matrix functions were constructed with these data for each of these acceleration values. Thus, the functions and matrixes of damage probability contributed to understand the damage that masonry buildings might endure in a given value of maximum acceleration in function of its vulnerability estimate. The functions defined in this study were utilized in the assessment of damages produced by a seism of a given level in buildings located at a sector of the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga at the Municipality of Floridablanca.",

Different pH variations were then carried out to the suspensions in a range of 2 to 12, in order to obtain changes in its surface chemistry as a colloid, and so, look at the variations as a pigment. Measurements of viscosity were taken to each suspension in a Brookfield\u00ae viscosimeter to determine this colloidal characteristic, and then the resultant materials were dried out to evaluate its pigment properties, just like intense shade paint, brightness, Hegman dispersability and reduced shade paint.

The model was developed under one-dimensional and homentropic flow conditions, therefore, not taking into account entropy variations by heat transfer and friction. The model was constructed using Euler's system of equations (generalized form of conservation of mass, momentum and energy) and an ideal gas state equation and then solved by finite volume methods. The spatial discretisation was made using a first order upwind scheme and the CFL number was used as stability criterion. The model results were validated by comparison with known analytical solutions of The Riemann and DeHaller problems. Deviations below 1% were obtained when CFL values were lesser than 0.1. Bigger CFL numbers (closer to 1) produced fast computer results but instabilities out of the physical phenomenon were present.",

The effect of different parameters such as initial concentration (0,025 to 0,1 M), H2 pressure partial (0,48 to 0,98 MPa), temperature (353 to 393 K) and catalyst loading (0,1 to 0,4 g) were examined. A high selectivity towards unsaturated alcohol (furfuryl alcohol) using this catalyst was demonstrated. The effect of solvent also was studied. The alcoholic solvents produces acetals traces, especially 2,6-diethyl-acetal. The initial rates of furfural hydrogenation increased linearly with the catalyst loading, indicating absence of mass transfer effects. The reaction kinetics was represented by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model (LH). A single site Langmuir-Hinshelwood type model suggesting the addition of a hydrogen atom on the organic molecules as the rate determining step provided the best fit of the experimental data.",

The inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions causes the defects to move at different velocities and slows the overall relaxation process, but this effect is suppressed by increasing the degree of confinement. The most notable flow features that develop in the system are large vortices that surround and follow the defects as they approach each other.",

The lubricant base consists of a mixture in a volume ratio of 74 parts of epoxidized sesame and 26 parts of transesterified sesame oil. This mixture was characterized by FT-IR, thermo-oxidative stability was determined and heating and cooling curves were performed, where a crystallization and solidification temperature of-8 \u00b0C was obtained. To improve the lubricating capacity of the oil blend concentrations of 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20% of copper nanoparticles (NPsCu) and alumina nanoparticles (NPsAl2O3) were added, which had been subjected to tribological tests for the wear scar measurement and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The addition of NPsCu and NPsAl 2 O 3 improved the lubricating power of oil base-stock. The NPsCu percentage in modified sesame oil that showed the best lubricating performance was in the interval between 0.15-0.2; as for the oil with NPsAl 2 O 3 better result was obtained with 0,05% of NPs. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) have researched and formulated computational mechanisms to ease Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). From the conceptual point of view, a NLP system can be divided into three main processes: morphology, syntax and semantics. Every process has to deal with multiple interpretations for the same word or phrase; as a result, ambiguity is originated. To solve ambiguity, statistics-based, artificial-intelligence-based, and hybrid methods have been proposed; however, there are still difficulties to be solved, for example wasting of lexical and computational resources and using of restricted-domain elements. Here in this paper we propose a method for solving coordinative and prepositional syntactic ambiguity; this method includes the definition of a set of heuristic rules. Also, we show the implementation of the method using the python language in conjunction with the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK), and we exemplify disambiguation of two case studies.",

The methodology applies parametric identification techniques to the linear dynamic of the excitation system model; for it, a small pseudo random binary signal is applied with the synchronous generator operating off line, which allows to reduce the testing time of the machines in relation to the step or frequency response methods. The remaining parameters for the non-linear components, as signal saturation and magnetic saturation in the exciters, are obtained from simple tests of great signal excursion. The methodology is illustrated in simulation by applying it to the IEEE ST1A model and experimentally to a self-excited digital excitation system, represented with the ST4B IEEE model. The experimental and simulation results show the validity of the proposed methodology, achieving success rates of 96% to 74% in simulation and experimentation.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, it was simulated the combustion process in a high velocity chamber, which uses highly preheated air and methane as fuel. The simulation was carried out with FLUENT and the grid was drawn with GAMBIT. These programs were used as designing tool to predict the performance of the combustion system when two different types of burners are tested, and there is not swirl generation. The first type of burner the fuel is injected axially. In the second one the fuel is injected radially. The models were: k - \u03b5 for turbulence, P1 for radiation and PDF-Mixture Fraction for combustion processes. The numerical results show that radial injection of fuel presents a better performance than axial injection with regard to combustion efficiency, also it is achieved a more complete combustion due to the better mix between air and fuel.",

We added 15, 20 and 25% of carbonate rocks with holding (% of CaCO3)&lt;70% (low-limestones), 70 - 80% and&gt;80% (high-limestones). Strength of the mortars to 3, 7 and 28 days was tested. The mineralogical evolution in pastes during the hydrate process was determined using X-Rays Diffraction and thermogravimetric Analysis. It is found that the low-limestone are a goodness option for blended cements still above of 20% because they had less negative effects on the strength in comparison with the high-limestone. The low-limestone did not change the setting time, expansion or water demands to blended mortars. The blended mortars with 20% of lowlimestone had an IP&gt;75% (ASTM C311), however, these low-limestones did not show pozzolanic activity because they did not produce the waiting mineralogical changes.",

    "Abstract": "It is proposed a method for the reconstruction of objects with surfaces type 2-variety differentiable, by using a network of NURBS patches, assembled of suitable form. The quadrilateralization, for the network of patches, becomes in the projection plane, by means of a Delaunay triangulation represented like a graph. Later, the NURBS surfaces are adjusted to these quadrilaterals, and then they are projected to the original space of the object, by using a point to point technique. Results are shown for each stage of the method. The time employed for the quadrilateralization depends on the number of points in the Delaunay graph and on the number of axes in the contour of the model. This time, for graphs with an elevated number of control points, is not longer than some seconds. For instance, for 58 control points and 570 axes this time is about 0,032s.",

Residual soils produced by weathering of the San Diego Stock in a tropical environment are found at the site. The shaking ground profile for the synthetic earthquake developed by the Medellin Seismologic Group (2002).was modelled using one-dimensinal propagation waves model and the SHAKE91 computer program. The results presented might help in the design of structures that are planned to be constructed in the same geological body and for which the lithologic profile does not match the typical presented in the Medellin Seismic Microzonation. Additionally geotechnical engineers will find paths for dynamic behavior generated from samples which present different intensities of weathering.

The knowledge of these relationships permits to have a better understanding of the tribological systems behavior for improving their design and their performance. This paper has as a goal to give for knowing a matrix-tool that is useful for the modeling of the 2-D problems of elastic contacts. Based on a generalization of Flamant's problem, this matrix constitutes a link between the perpendicular displacements to the surface experienced by some points on this and the shape of the distribution of the load in the contact zone. This link permits to find one of these variables as a function of the other. The matrix is a very simple tool and has huge useful for the solution of complex problems of this kind. For showing its useful, the matrix was used to resolve the elastic contact problem between two long cylinders, a problem initially formulated and solved by Hertz; the found results are the same as those obtained by Hertz in his analytical solution.",

    "Abstract": "This work researches the influence of the nickel content on the structural and anticorrosive properties of ZrSiTiN films deposited by means of reactive co-sputtering on alloys of Ti6Al4V. The morphology and structure were analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the chemical composition was identified via X-ray scattering spectroscopy (EDS). The corrosion resistance was studied using potentiodynamic polarization (PP) tests employing a 3.5% by weight NaCl solution. In the films, an increase of Ni up to 6.97 at% was observed, while in XRD the FCC phase of (Zr, Ti) N was identified, with a mixed orientation in planes (111) and (200), which tended to diminish with the increase of Ni. Finally, with the addition of Ni, the corrosion current densities were reduced from 5.56 X 10 \u22128 to 2.64 X 10 \u22129 A\u2044Cm 2 . The improvement in the corrosion resistance is due to the effect of the Ni on the microstructure of the system (Zr, Ti) N, which can improve the quality of the passive film and prevent crystalline defects and corrosion zones. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Such complexity impacts the opportunity and accuracy of diagnostic, and these issues are particularly important for actual time analisis where adecuate actions should be taken in order to restablish the electric power system. In this paper a neural network with bayessian regularization learning and early finalization is proposed for fault classification ussing osciloperturbography records and its efectivity is shown for a wide variety of training and validation cases which are obtenied with an ATP model where the required electric faults were simulated.",

It was obtained a concentrated fraction in organic matter (beneficiated fraction) for each separation stage. Yield of beneficiated fractions obtained in the first separation stage were in the range 28 to 58%. Using the second separation stage, the maximum yield obtained for Guachinte coal was 71%. Ash content of beneficiated coal fractions was between 6.84 and 24.68%, which was lower than feed fractions 23.39 y 43.29%. A reduction in sulphur content was also found in beneficiated fractions of Guachinte coal in comparison to feed fractions, however, a contrary behavior was obtained for Golondrinas coal.",

It was used a sampling methodology of low density and it was taken soil samples at the A horizon, analysed for 48 elements using (ICP-MS) and neutronic activation. The first three components represent 88% of the total variability of the data, showing associations as: CP1=V-Sb-Mo-Cr-Ni-Zn-Cu-U, with a 73% of the variance and with the major numbers of elements that can be relational to lithologies as lodolites and sandstone maybe some rich in uranium and others metals. The second principal component CP2=Ni-Zn-Cu could be with relationship to sulphur bearing ore deposits, and finally CP3=Mo-V-Ni-Sb-Cr indicates a natural association to lithologies as shales that act as metal scavenger. For the first principal component (CP1) it was generated a krigging map applying geostatistic techniques.",

According to the scanning electron microscopy - Energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) structural analysis, the composite Nafion /TiO2 membranes had a two layer - structure, one layer enriched with the ceramic particles, and the other less concentrated but well dispersed. The ethanol crossover rate through these membranes and swelling degree at different temperatures and different concentrations has been investigated and compared with unmodified Nafion membrane. The experimental results show that the swelling degree of these membranes gets higher as ethanol solution concentration and temperature increases and the same results were obtained for the ethanol crossover rate increases. The water swelling is increased either what would allow higher working temperatures and lower relative humidity and improve the fuel cell performances.",

    "Abstract": "Companies normally generate rich sets of data, related to production, waste, energy and environmental parameters. These numbers have a great potential to be used as rational means to establish goals for continuous improvement, waste minimization, energy use reduction and environmental pollution control. However, this is not the case, in general, because people in charge lack knowledge on how to use the data for this purpose. It is common that fixed goals are set without real bases, with no relationship to production levels or energy and waste real data. This paper shows how to use data for monitoring process and targeting goals for waste minimization and specific energy use reduction. It is based on the experience of the author on applying this practice to more than 20 industrial cases.",

    "Abstract": "The integrity of actives in the petroleum industry is highly important for safety reasons, compliance of environmental regulations, reduction of maintenance cost and prevention of unexpected production shut-down. The objective of this article is to establish a methodology to evaluate the integrity of wells that use electric heating as enhanced oil recovery method, in such a way that can be established if the wells in study are under appropriate mechanic - metallurgic conditions to implement this method. The proposed methodology can be divided in the following stages: planning, evaluation approaches and analysis of results. The planning is directed toward the elaboration of a working plan that will be carried out in the system with the purpose of gathering historical information of inspection, maintenance and rate of corrosion calculations; to evaluate the current conditions an evaluation womb is used in order that determines the applicability of the method of electric heating in the wells in function of the parameters that define the ambient of the system and the coating material. After analyzing the results it is determined if the well is capable for the application of the recovery method. Finally the article shows two examples of application of the methodology to the wells of the HOCOL's Hocha field from Huila - Colombia. The major contribution of this article is the development of a methodology that allows to evaluate different structural and operation parameters to give a diagnosis of the well before designing and implementing the electric heating as recovery method, avoiding this way economic losses.",

Therefore, this work used leaching equations to evaluate systems of remediation of soils salinized by excess fertilizers. The phases of the study were: salinization of soils in lysimeters, remediation of these soils, and measurement of salt concentrations in soils for comparison with estimates of empirical equations. The treatments combined soil remediation systems (continuous and intermittent) with five initial levels of soil salinity (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 10.0 dS m-1). The experimental design was randomized blocks with six replicates. The Volobuyev equation best represented the salinized soil remediation in relation to the results obtained experimentally.

The results showed the potential of the mixture as a culture medium, after reaching polymer concentrations of 3.17 g/L in MSM medium and 2.71 g/L in M/V medium with a molasses/vinasse ratio of 25/75. There was a sugar (sucrose, fructose, and glucose) consumption yield of 70.7%, and a biopolymer accumulation of 97.8% with respect to the biomass produced.

    "Abstract": "Quick movements of flow control system devices can produce transient flows where vapor pressure is reached, creating two-phase flows: liquid-vapor. Cavitation can be present in some cases. Under these conditions, the flow is characterized by spatial and temporal changes in the velocity of pressure waves due to an increase in the void fraction. Typically the wave velocity in two-phase flows is determined using an isothermal assumption like Wylie's equation. In this research the adiabatic assumption was introduced and a new equation was obtained. Experimental set up was built; the results were used to analyze the system response and to study the wave velocity variation along the distributed vaporous cavitation zone and the vapor cavity. The experimental results were compared to numerical simulations assuming adiabatic and isothermal bubble vapor behavior. A good prediction of the maximum pressures magnitude was obtained with both models; however, both models predicted longer time intervals between consecutive pressure pulses compared to the measured data. In general, better predictions were obtained with the adiabatic wave velocity expression. The volume of the vapor cavity obtained by using adiabatic or isothermal behavior was similar; however, both models predicted the creation of additional cavities not detected in the experimental results.",

    "Abstract": "Full comprehension of adsorption and further oxidation of CO molecules on platinum is fundamental to develop polymer exchange membrane fuel cells operating at low temperature. In this work it is presented an overview of the five more important experimental strategies in the search to improve the CO tolerance: reduce the on set potential for the CO oxidation reaction, reduce the amount of adsorbed CO, introduce small quantities of oxidant bleeding into the anode feed, increase the operation temperature and cleaning the CO in the fuel feed. Even though quite promissory catalysts have been developed (PtMo and PdAu mixtures), still the PtRu systems are regarded as the most efficient anode catalysts for fuels containing over 10 ppm of CO. The strategy of inject oxygen to the anode appears promissory, but it requires the development of new more efficient membranes and the implementation of more safe operation conditions of the fuel cell. The structural design of special anodes containing multiple layers with specific catalysts for each type of fuel can become a very attractive strategy.",

The challenge is even greater, considering that the 90% of companies in these countries are small and medium enterprises (SMEs). To evaluate water management in food SMEs in Colombia, a case study was conducted in a poultry processing plant. Operation was determined by technical visits, measurements and water balances and the performance was evaluated by a sensitivity analysis. Total water consumption was 206,2m3.d-1 finding performances between 10,9 and 28,8 L.chicken-1. The areas of plucking and evisceration were responsible for 62% and cleaning for 19% of water use.

Using measures of zeta potential and flotation in tube Hallimond, confirmed that the flotation of the kaolinite is dependent of the pH and of the concentration of the collector. The conditions of better flotability are presented to pH=4.1 and 3.75*10-4 M of CTAB. The interaction mineral/collector happens by means of a mechanism adsorption/precipitation. The infrared spectroscopy for transformed of Fourier (FTIR) it allowed to determine that the cations of the amine forms strong bonding, type bridges of hydrogen, with the groups present silanol in the mineral surface. The evolution of characteristic bands of species adsorbed corresponding to the vibrations N-H is observed, OR-H, If-OH and Si(Al)-O. The attraction of CTAB on the kaolinite surface causes a reduction in the intensities of the bands corresponding to the vibrations OH and new bands appear in the region understood between 3500 and 3700 cm-1. When working with concentrations of the collector of 4.76*10-4M the formation of micelar structures strong it is appreciated on the surface of the kaolinite and a decrease is observed in the flotation answer.",

This work considers from the Systems Theory the interaction of the entropic components of Mexican urban mobility through the model entropy-homeostasis-negentropy, which is an adaptation of the model pressure-status-response, issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development with the intention of showing qualitatively which is the most probable scenario of the private electric vehicle for urban mobility. The results show that a larger number of vehicles produce a higher intra-systemic entropy. Thus, it is essential to implement definitive negentropies to favour electric mobility. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The Rietveld method was used in order to determine the amount of crystalline phases present in aluminum dross with particle size less than 3.35 mm. Initially, the dross was separated in four granulometric fractions by screening. Two samples of each granulometric size were obtained by means of quartering and homogenization. Each sample was grounded and subsequently analyzed by X-ray diffraction in order to identify and quantify the crystalline phases present in the dross. Metallic aluminum, aluminum oxide, spinel, defect spinel, diaoyudaoite and aluminum nitride were identified and then quantified by the Rietveld method. In order to observe the dependence of the particle size with the amount of each phase, statistical analyses was done by means of analyses of variance (ANOVA). The coefficient of determination R2 was greater than 94% for all phases except for the NaAl11O17 phase. Thus, the amount of each crystalline phase is satisfactory explained by particle size. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Drinking Water Treatment Plants (DWTP) must ensure safe water supply; to this end, we applied risk assessment tools for the development of the Water Safety Plan (WSP) in a DWTP from Cali-Colombia, which supplies 1.4 million inhabitants. For the identification of hazards and risk assessment, four tools were used: exploratory analysis of turbidity data, inspection visits, hazard/hazardous event matrix and semiquantitative matrix. Under normal and extreme conditions of turbidity (>400-2500 UNT), it has been guaranteed the turbidity of treated water of 0.39 \u00b1 0.15 UNT, showing the robustness of the DWTP. It was found that sixty percent of the 40 hazardous events had a very high risk level without considering control measures and it was possible reduce to 7% with existing control measures.

    "Abstract": "Recent developments in engineering have promoted the use of reinforced composite materials from natural fibers, which provides an opportunity to investigate such materials using state-of the-art tools. Here we present a morphological and nanomechanical characterization of the parallel section of the axis of guadua Angustifolia kunth fibers (GAK) from Colombia, focusing on properties such as hardness (nanoindentation), roughness and topography. Our method was based on the application of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). AFM provided curves of force by displacement, as well as characteristics of dynamic nanoindentation systems and images. Their analysis revealed ridges and valleys on the surface of GAK fibers. The estimated surface roughness of 9.51 nm suggests an adequate value to provide superior adhesion between polymer and fiber. The same conclusion follows from our measurements of hardness, reduced modulus and nanoscale topography. Due to their excellent properties, we conclude that GAK fibers represent an ideal reinforcement material in polymer matrices. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Currently, in addition to the Colombian Seismic Resistant Construction Regulations, last updated in 2010 (NSR-2010), there are other mandatory construction regulation that have been issued after 2010, producing an additional cost per square-meter of constructed area and exceeding the maximum limits established for these types of residential projects. Adjust the project to the established limits result in area reduction of the areas and quality of construction finishes of the final product. In this research, historical statistics of the construction costs of VIS and VIP in Cali are reviewed, and the impact on the cost of these housing types with respect to the inclusion of new technical dispositions is evaluated.

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a methodology to estimate the Levelized Avoided Cost of Electricity (LACE) of new generation projects based on the assessment of economic and operational benefits perceived by an existing power system. The marginal economic benefit caused by the integration of a new generation project is captured using the Differential Revenue Requirement method (DRR); whereas the operational benefits are observed by analyzing the performance of the new project through a preventive DC Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SCOPF) tool. The SCOPF also allows quantifying economic benefits due to replacement of expensive generation, transmission congestion, and N-1 security improvement. Additionally, another metric, called Net Benefit (NB) of a generation project, expressed as the difference between LACE and LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) is also employed in this work. It provides a realistic, easy-to-compute, and intuitive index that helps identifying the most promising generation projects during system expansion planning procedures. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied for computing LACE and NB of different generation projects in Colombia. According to the results, geothermal projects display the most significant LACE and NB. These metrics (LACE and NB) can become useful tools for decision-making in planning process. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

In particular, in previous works have proposed a hierarchical architecture for a MJSE, composed of sub-motors. The main objective of this work is to specify the sub-motors responsible for the emergence process of the serious game, which are based on the algorithm of optimization based on ant colonies (ACO). These sub-motors carry out the management of the set of game frames according to the educational context of interest, in such a way to merge them into a single frame, in order to make the dynamic of the serious game emerge. Additionally, this paper analyzes the behavior of the sub-motors in a case study, with very encouraging results. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Second, to minimize the risks of product losses in transportation. Third, to minimize the environmental impact of CO2 emissions produced by transportation and storage operations. The proposed model is solved with two approaches: First, a commercial solver to compute the Pareto-optimal set of solutions. Second, a simulation-based optimization approach that allows to obtain statistically different but efficient solutions such that the decision-maker will be able to trade-off objectives while considering only Pareto optimal solutions.

This is an important aspect to achieve the performance goals of high responsiveness and high throughput that is expected in Cloud Applications (e.g. search engines, social networks, and e-commerce sites). These goals are tightly associated with the prioritization of short flows (a few KB in size), the majority for these applications rather than long flows (several MB in size). However, these applications usually cannot provide information in advance about the size of the flows. In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of providing dynamic adjustment for a MLFQ-based scheduling system in such a way that it adapts itself to the time and space variations exhibited by Data Center Network (DCN) traffic without requiring prior information about workload properties. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Erosion is the main form of degradation in the world, consequently of loss of soil, water and nutrients, provoking direct and indirect damages. The objective of this work is to quantify N, P and K losses by water erosion under simulated rainfall conditions by the application of six erosion tests in continuous cultivation of seasonal cycle species, including isolated and intercropped crops. The study was carried out in the field at the Experimental Station of Agronomy in Eldorado do Sul (RS), Brazil, in a typical Dystrophic Red Argisol. For the analysis of nutrient loss, six erosion tests with simulated rainfall were applied to the treatments between the end of October and mid-December, using the rain simulator with swivel arms of Swanson. The losses of N and P were influenced by surface conditions, with the partial removal of crop residues and the non-mobilization of the soil. The exception was K, due to its high solubility in the soil with a low colloidal activity, which was easily lost in the soil water surface runoff, regardless of total soil surface coverage by crop residues. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In the production of ethanol from agroindustrial crop residues, one of the critical stages in the process is the conversion of lignocellulosic material to simple sugars, which can be done chemically or enzymatically. In this research, the enzymatic activities of commercial enzymes were evaluated for their influence on the degradation of lignocellulosic materials from sugar cane harvest residues (leaves and top cane). Eight substrates were pretreated with different delignification methods. Likewise, five enzymatic preparations were configured. An analysis of the enzyme-substrate interactions was conducted through fuzzy system analysis. The results showed regions of maximum enzymatic activity for residues of the sugarcane harvest, between 20-30 Filter Paper Units (FPU) /mL values lower than 500 pNPG (p-Nitrofenol-\u03b1-D-Glucopyranoside) U / mL of activity beta-glucosidase and hemicellulase activity between 50 and 70 IU / mL, confirming that the use of large amounts of cellulolytic enzymes is not necessary. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has emerged as the dominant architecture for interoperability between applications, by using a weak-coupled model, based on the flexibility provided by Web Services, which has led to a wide range of applications, in what is known as cloud computing. On the other hand, Multiagent System (MAS) is widely used in the industry, because it provides an appropriate solution to complex problems in a proactive and intelligent way. Specifically, the Educational Smart Environments (AmI) obtain great benefits by using both architectures, because MAS endows intelligence to the environment, while SOA enables users to interact with academic services in the cloud. The purpose of this article is to propose an architecture for bidirectional integration SOA-MAS to be used on educational AmI.

    "Abstract": "The objective of this paper is to present the development and application of a method to estimate the heavy metal (HM) contribution derived from the wash-off by runoff on road-deposited sediments (RDS) in a high-altitude megacity (Bogota, Colombia). The method is based on the development of a HM wash-off equation which considers two processes: HM transportation and HM leaching. HM contribution by runoff ranges between 24.7% and 50.3%, relative to the total mass per unit area of HMs associated with dry-weather RDS (Mn, Cd, As, Zn, Cu, Ba, Pb, and Fe). The HMs that show a greater contribution are Cd, Zn, and Mn. RDS size fraction below 250 \u00b5m contributes on average 81.6% of the total HM load washed-off by runoff. The findings suggest that the RDS size fraction below 250 \u00b5m must be the reference fraction for the control systems design of HM pollution in Bogota city. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Spectral indexes and supervised image classification were calculated to differentiate the ice boundary. Between 2010 and 2015 the ice sheet of the volcanoes under study has reated 24%, 42% and 60% respectively. The coherence images show similar results as those obtained by optical images. The use of coherence images can be used for the delimitation of ice and rock in glacial areas.

    "Abstract": "Construction and demolition waste (CDW) have become a constant problem due to its volume of production and the lack of space for its final disposal. Several management strategies have been proposed to solve this problem as the reduction in the source of generation or the reuse as raw material. Nonetheless, for many cases this process is not consistent because CDW nature and its properties are not considered as an important variable in the identification of its possible reutilization. For this paper, an example of the potential reuse identification with regards to construction and demolition waste of Medellin city is presented. For this purpose, the physical, mineralogical and energetic properties were determined, as well as the specific amount of production. The results showed that the greatest potential reuse for CDW is associated to excavation waste and block masonry. Furthermore, based on the latter, a reuse model consisting in a soil-cement plate with 95% CDW was established. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Sediment transport is an important process for rivers and natural channels. The determination of sediment transport is a very complex process due to the high variability and changing nature of the factors that intervene. As a contribution to the description of this kind of phenomenon and to highlight the problems, the needs and potentials of the numerical approaches, OpenFOAM solver settlingFoam is used to simulate sediment transport in a rectangular channel. The model used constitutes a simplification of a complex procedure based on the application of a single parameter (alpha) to determine the fluid-sediment mixture features. High variability was found between the results from different alpha values. Nevertheless, there is a lack of information to determine the appropriate value of this parameter. However, even though the procedure applied and the results obtained have to be taken as a reference, this study provides valuable criteria for future research of this complex topic. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The boom in the construction of large engineering works has boosted the demand for steel, which has generated an increase in the production of steel waste, a situation that causes environmental problems due to the accumulation and inadequate disposal of these by-products. The use of industrial waste in different processes must be focused on sustainable development and the protection of the environment. This work was developed with the objective of ratifying the use of Basic Oxygen Furnace slag (BOF) as coarse aggregate and studying the alternative of using Blast Furnace Dust (BFD) as a fine aggregate; to manufacture asphalt hot mixes for pavements as an alternative to mitigate the environmental problems derived from the accumulation of this steel waste and the exploitation of non-renewable materials, such as gravel and sand. To achieve the objective, three types of asphalt mixtures were analyzed, a mixture with conventional materials (control) and two mixtures that partially and totally replace the coarse aggregate with BOF and the fine aggregate with BFD. The design of the mixtures was made with the RAtional Methodology for COmpacted geomaterials' DEnsification and Strength Analysis (RAMCODES), which is based on the principle of the vacuum polygon. Tests were carried out to evaluate the physical characteristics and the susceptibility to water and plastic deformation of each type of mixture. The results of this study confirm the use of BOF and indicate that it is feasible to use BFD as fine aggregate to partially replace conventional aggregates in road paving. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) method was used to determine the fraction of nitrogen released, and the effect of the device on a bioindicator (Zea mays) was studied in greenhouse conditions. Structural damage to the device after its application to soil was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Kjeldahl tests showed the device released less than 15% of total nitrogen across a 60 day evaluation period, displaying a Fickian diffusion pattern.

The adhesive was tested following curing for various times, and the bonding of the adhesive with several materials was investigated to determine whether it has the potential for greater versatility of application. Therefore, we explored new uses of the adhesive, such as in the matrix of a composite with fiberglass.

The coagulants used were type A aluminum sulfate, type B aluminum sulfate and ferric chloride. An experiment was designed to study water with initial turbidity between 25 and 30 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). The experiment consisted of filling a sedimentation column with water and colloid particles which were agitated rapidly and then slowly with compressed air. This allowed the percentage of particles removed from the remaining turbidity to be determined at different times and different depths by measuring sedimentation of the flocculated particles. Once percentages of material removed had been calculated, an isoconcentration graph was elaborated and multiple linear regression was used to determine the coefficients of the model proposed by San. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, the effect of the proportion of a hyperbranched polyester polyol (HBP) of fourth generation on the structural, thermal, rheological, morphological and mechanical properties of tapioca starch/HBP blends (TPS) was evaluated. For this purpose, the ratios of starch:HBP employed to prepare the TPS were: 30:70 (TPS30), 40:60 (TPS40) and 50:50 (TPS50). Using infrared (IR) analysis, it was observed that the presence of HBP produced a displacement at the absorptions of the C-OH, C-O and C-O-C bonds of the TPS. The X-ray diffraction (DRX) analysis showed that the starch crystallinity is A and B type, which increased with the HBP amount. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the TPS, increased with the HBP content, but the thermal stability and viscosity (at an angular frequency of 1 Hz) presented an opposite behavior. The scanning electronic microscopy analysis (SEM) revealed that the granular structure of the starch was not completely destructured. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this research the effect of the addition of silica fume (SF) and fly ash (FA) to the ordinary Portland cement (OPC), individually and in combination, on rheology, compressive strength and self-compacting capacity in mixtures of cement were evaluated. At the beginning, the physicochemical characterization of the raw materials was carried out using XRF, SEM and PSD. Subsequently the rheological analysis was done in order to determine yield stress and plastic viscosity, then the compressive strength was measured at 7 and 28 days of normal curing. Finally, the measurement of the self-compacting capacity by means of a V-funnel was performed. It was found that the FA influences positively because it reduces yield stress and self-compacting test times, but decreases the compressive strength in comparison to control sample. The addition of SF increases the yield stress and self-compacting times, but positively influences the compressive strength. By analyzing the combinations of FA and SF additions the effects of each one are maintained allowing finding an addition range that delivered efficient values for the performance of fresh and hardened state of the blended cement pastes. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Synergy in anaerobic codigestion is described as positive interactions between a substrate and cosubstrate(s). Synergistic effects increase methane production over the weighted average methane production from monodigestion. Limited current knowledge defines synergy as a parameter in the plant control and design and in solving operational problems. In this study, synergy was determined in the anaerobic codigestion of chicken manure with industrial wastes (sugarcane molasses, cheese whey, and crude glycerol). A simplex lattice mixture design was used to determine mixing ratios. Synergy was assessed in terms of substrate composition and ammonia inhibition. The greatest synergistic effects were achieved with ternary mixtures. Synergy was also noticed when total ammonia nitrogen concentrations decreased and the organic load increased. Nonetheless, it was concluded that synergy could be reliably achieved when cosubstrate supplementation reduces ammonia inhibition and increases methane production as increases in organic load. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The PET-profiles are placed in a unidirectional and bidirectional fiber matrix with soft pre-tensioned condition that they could have advantages in structural members made of concrete in some precise applications, for instance, road safety barriers. A universal machine (WDW-200E) is used to test PET-profiles with different width, knots and even other conditions. The desired PET profile is chosen and the concrete mixture is designed under the ACI standard guidance. Pre-stressed PET-profiles are included in wood molds shaped in beam-type and subsequently flexural strength is estimated. Furthermore, experimental tests results are presented for PET-profiles as structural reinforcement of beams made of concrete under pure flexural. Finally, a probabilistic model is used to estimate the PET contribution in terms of exceedance of the rupture modulus. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Zirconia is a material that is susceptible to changes in its structure from the tetragonal to the monoclinic phase caused by variations in temperature or by contact with water. One way of achieving the stability of the tetragonal phase at low temperatures is by incorporating anionic gaps in its crystal lattice through doping procedures with aliovalent anions such as nitrogen. Nitrogen replaces the oxygen in the crystal lattice, which stabilizes the tetragonal structure of zirconia at low temperatures. The aim of this research was to evaluate the degradation of nitrided zirconia 3Y-TZP after it was immersed in artificial saliva for 0, 7, 14, and 21 days. Interfacial processes such as oxide-formation were assessed simultaneously using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy test.

    "Abstract": "NiO has a variety of applications, mainly in the production of electrochemical sensors and of metallic nickel. In addition, it is widely used as catalysts to produce hydrogen from natural gas. In this work, hydrotalcites based on nickel-aluminum and nickel-zinc-aluminum were synthesized, calcined at 500 \u00b0C and studied by different techniques. It was observed that nickel-aluminum hydrotalcites are thermally more stable, collapsing at higher temperatures than hydrotalcites containing zinc. During calcination, aluminum is incorporated into NiO lattice, leading to a decrease in crystallographic parameters. However, zinc decreases this effect, favoring the formation of NiO with lattice parameters close to pure nickel oxide. Zinc also contributes to the formation of smaller NiO particles, which is very useful for its use as a catalyst. In addition, aluminum led to a distortion in NiO lattice, an effect that is minimized by zinc, showing that it hinders the incorporation of Al3+ in the NiO lattice. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This work deals with the comparison of the theoretical assignment of the DADP vibrational spectrum with the experimental displacements by isotopic labeling. For this, the DADP-C4 and DADP-C2 isotopomers were synthesized from acetone labeled isotopically in the methyl and the carbonyl carbon atoms, respectively. The acetone and DADP-isotopomer compounds were characterized using Raman and infrared spectroscopy. Theoretical assignments were taken from previous studies on the potential energy distribution of a vibrational mode, which provide an approach to the internal coordinates related to each band. The selective isotopic labeling allowed us to approach to the dependence of each band, because the energy of a molecular vibration also depends on the reciprocal mass of the atoms involved. In general, the results showed that some bands assigned experimentally do not coincide with the theoretical assignments by quantum mechanical simulations. \u00a9 The author.",

    "Abstract": "Synthetic sea level (SL) records of the Cartagena Bay and the Urab\u00e1 Gulf, from 1991 to 2010, were obtained through this methodology. Simulated series were adjusted against different probability functions (e.g. Log-Normal, Normal, Weibull, Gumbel). Normal and Gumbel distributions provided the best fit for mean and extreme regimes, respectively. Within the Cartagena Bay, there were no significant differences in the mean regime; whereas for the Urab\u00e1 Gulf its magnitude increased as much as twice southward. Moreover, the extreme regime exhibited the largest values in the southern sector of the Urab\u00e1 Gulf. This methodology might be implemented in areas where sea level records are scarce or poorly reliable. Thus, it may valuable for planning and building port and coastal infrastructure, as well as for implementing risk reduction measures. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Its very nature has made the construction of road tunnels the primary option for improving transport infrastructure, despite the fact that communities located in the scope of the projects have reported being negatively affected by them. The main objective was to carry out a critical analysis of the management implemented during the execution of the Fernando G\u00f3mez Mart\u00ednez Tunnel project. This was achieved using ex-post evaluation methodology-based models, whereby the main results are based on deficiencies in management from the planning and execution stages of the project, together with weaknesses in the process of licensing, monitoring and control by the environmental authority. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This method is directly applicated in the discharge of the mills and / or classifiers to recover free and coarse gold; which size is superior than approximately 150 micrometers. Physicochemical characterization of the free gold surfaces was carried out by the measurements of contact angle, Z potential (ZPC) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The reagent was determined by specific conditions (basic pH, no requirements of an activator and a flotation time of the order of 2 minutes) achieving a superior recovery than 90%. In this case, the isoamyl dialkyl dithiophosphate collector (AERO 3501\u00ae) was the reagent which basically got the best results. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper proposes the glass-ceramics method for obtaining lithium ion (Li+) solid electrolytes. This technique provides high chemical and microstructural homogeneity as well as low porosity. Glass samples were subjected to either single or double heat treatments, between 700 \u00b0C and 1000 \u00b0C, in order to obtain the glass-ceramics. Differential Scanning Calorimetry \u2013 DSC \u2013 results evidenced the possibility of fabricating these ceramics from glass in the system Li2O\u00b7Al2O3\u00b7TiO2\u00b7P2O5. Samples observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy \u2013 SEM \u2013 showed a finely grained microstructure which was homogeneously distributed and non-porous. X-ray Diffraction \u2013 XRD \u2013 patterns showed the formation of the high conducting phase LiTi2(PO4)3. A high ionic conductivity, in the order of 10-3S/cm at 1000 \u00b0C, was measured by Impedance Spectroscopy \u2013 IS. It suggests that the synthesis method used in this research is useful for fabricating lithium ion glass-ceramics and opens up a new alternative for manufacturing different electrical ceramics. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

By means of X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction the chemical composition and crystallographic phases of raw materials were analyzed, morphology and particle size was determinate using Scanning Electron Microscopy. The materials were deposit by oxyacetylene thermal spray on silica-alumina refractory bricks and high alumina low cement concrete, commercial references ER-40 and CBC-50 from ERECOS S.A.S.. The parameters used for the coating deposition were optimized based on preliminary test and simulations using the Jets&powders software. The chromite mineral coating displayed greater structure homogeneity than the other two coatings; the last ones presented partially melted particles and high porosity. However, based on the chemical composition, the response to adhesion test and the crystallographic phases present in the coatings, all of them are potential candidates to be used as protective barriers against corrosive effects on refractories. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Lightning electric field (LEF) measurements are aperiodic signals characterized by inherent noise of different sources, i.e., it is not possible to register a noise-free signal. In the last decade, the denoising of LEF measurements has been achieved using some time-frequency representations such as short-time Fourier transform (STFT), wavelet transform (WT) and fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) without definitive results. In this paper, a denoising process applied on LEF measurements using the Local Polynomial Approximation (LPA) is proposed. The window size selection is made by combining the LPA with the intersection of confidence intervals (ICI) algorithm. Furthermore, a cross-validation criterion is used to select the optimal value of the threshold parameter in the LPA-ICI denoising method. It is shown that for different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values, the proposed method significantly reduces the noise present in the recorded signals. Finally, a discussion about the processed signatures in terms of some lightning electric field temporal features is performed. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Despite several research programs and global efforts to establish a sustainable microalgae-based industry, most applications have not transcended academic boundaries. This limitation raises from the high transformation costs when target products are biofuels or fertilizers. Microalgae biorefinery emerges as an alternative to improve economic competitiveness, as Under such a model scope, the process inputs come from industrial waste, while biomass exploitation prioritizes the highest value molecules followed by extraction of less valuable compounds. This review describes a wide range of microalgae exploitation schemes focused on new uses of its constituents, while discussing emerging technologies designed to improve production and efficiencies as well. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

One of the potentialities evaluated through RPA is the use of VI, which may be extracted from digital images obtained by cameras that contain only the visible band. It may be an alternative for farmers who do not have access to RPA coupled with high-tech embedded sensors.

    "Abstract": "In reliability analysis, both the Weibull and the lognormal distributions are analyzed by using the observed data logarithms. While the Weibull data logarithm presents skewness, the lognormal data logarithm is symmetrical. This paper presents a method to discriminate between both distributions based on: 1) the coefficients of variation (CV), 2) the standard deviation of the data logarithms, 3) the percentile position of the mean of the data logarithm and 4) the cumulated logarithm dispersion before and after the mean. The efficiency of the proposed method is based on the fact that the ratio of the lognormal (b1ln) and Weibull (b1w) regression coefficients (slopes) b1ln/b1w efficiently represents the skew behavior. Thus, since the ratio of the lognormal (Rln) and Weibull (Rw) correlation coefficients Rln/Rw (for a fixed sample size) depends only on the b1ln/b1w ratio, then the multiple correlation coefficient R2 is used as the index to discriminate between both distributions. An application and the impact that a wrong selection has on R(t) are given also. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this work was to evaluate the production of hydrogen in a conventional and hybrid Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactors by modifying the hydraulic retention time (HRT). Both reactors operated continuously close to 135 days, with organic loading rate (OLR) of 11.26 kgCOD.m-3.d-1 at 12, 8 and 4 h. In the hybrid reactor, Biopack\u00ae rings with polyurethane foam at its center were used. The results showed that the UASB hybrid reactor achieved a stable and continuous production of over 60% of hydrogen gas at each HRT, related to carbon dioxide reduction until the end of the operation. The ANOVA and TUKEY tests, with a 95% reliability level, showed that there was a significant difference between the HRT evaluated, observing that the highest hydrogen production was obtained with 4 h of HRT. In the conventional UASB reactor, there was no stability during the operation time. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Goods distribution processes must reconcile the economic interests of the companies, which seek higher levels of profitability through costs reduction and service level improvements, with the negative impacts to society and environment, such as chemical pollution and the generation of vehicular congestion and accidents. This paper presents the comparison of three models that analyze the logistics costs associated with the distribution of goods and the greenhouse gas emissions generated by such processes. These models use the Vehicle Routing Problem (IRP) as the basis for optimizing the logistics activities, from which, through multi-objective approaches the CO2 emissions are analyzed. As the main result of the article, it can be observed that the multiobjective models allow finding an adequate combination between logistics costs and emissions, which is attractive to companies and society. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper introduces a novel physical model for measuring the hydraulic conductivity of granular materials in saturated conditions. An innovation in the location of the device\u2019s piezometers allows the device to be used to assess the permeability of layered soils for both parallel and perpendicular flows. The model\u2019s square section construction makes soil compaction easy. Design methodology took issues of construction, calibration and implementation into account. Permeability coefficients in directions parallel and perpendicular to soil stratification were measured, and Student\u2019s t-test was performed for the relation of experimental results and existing numerical correlations. Analysis of the results shows that the physical model can replicate seepage in layered soils with parallel and perpendicular flows as occurs in field. Furthermore, it was found that it is possible to validate the experimental calibration data by use of statistical techniques. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the performance of two concrete mixtures with the addition of B. subtilis spores regarding their capacity of filling cracks during the curing time, evaluating whether the addition can influence the compressive strength of the concrete. For so, six concrete mixtures were studied divided in two mix compositions: 1:1:2 and 1:2:3 (cement: sand: gravel) with w/c of 0.33 and 0.45, respectively. For each composition were added concentrations of 0, 0.3x108 or 1.2x108 of B. subtilis spores/mL. The results showed that all the samples with spores addition presented crystals precipitation, possibly calcium carbonate, that visually filled the cracks. However, more studies of microstructural analysis should be conducted to prove that the cracks were closed. The compressive strength presented satisfactory results, because the addition of 1.2x108 spores/mL did not present significant differences in compressive strength at probability level of 5%, when compared to the reference concrete. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

In this work the sedimentation dynamics of Glutathione@MNPs were evaluated for water systems with addition of calcium, zinc and sodium ions in a concentration range of 0-40 mg/L in the presence and absence of a vertical magnetic field of 0.2 T. Also, critical coagulation concentrations (CCC) were determined based on the DLVO theory. Particles stability in the absence of metal ions higher than 8 weeks could be observed, whereas in the presence of these ions the stability was reduced to 8 weeks. Separation of the material from the aqueous phase higher than 90% was obtained both for the presence of ions and for the material after the addition of heavy metals such as Hg and Cr. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The clinical and industrial importance of clavulanic acid (CA) promotes the search for novel strategies to boost productivity at lower costs. In this contribution, the production of CA was evaluated in two reference strains of Streptomyces clavuligerus (Sc), ATCC27064 and DSM41826; the strains were tested in different culture media, using product yields and culture media costs as selection criteria. On average, ScATCC reached a concentration of CA 1.6-fold higher than ScDSM, using the isolated soybean protein (ISP) culture medium. A central composite experimental design was used to optimize the medium, by studying the influence of ISP and K2HPO4 concentration on the production of CA. The maximum CA concentration obtained in this optimized medium was 56 mg\u00b7L-1, close to the theoretical optimum. Our results confirm that a culture medium containing a rich carbon source such as glycerol and/or starch provides the best conditions for CA production. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "We propose to find the model of relationship between Transformational Leadership and University Management. The Inventory of Leadership Practices form was used (LPI) as well as a University Management (UG) scale, which consists of four dimensions: Research, Teaching, Extension and Support. These dimensions were applied to managers of 31 universities in Colombia. To identify the global relationship model between university management and the dimensions associated with transformational leadership a multiple regression model was developed. Furthermore, in order to eliminate subjectivities, we applied the transformation test of ordinal scales in a new Ridit-type scale until reaching the results. Among the main findings, there is a model of direct and positive relationship between Transformational Leadership and University Management. We also found that the Enabling to Act dimension in Transformational Leadership is the one having the greatest impact in university management.

Methods: Methods: human lymphocytes were exposed to pristine and N-doped carbon nanotubes (NTC) (0.08, 0.09, 0.1mg/mL). Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and chromosomal alterations (CA) tests were evaluated. Results: chromatid breaks and chromosomal breaks (double strand breaks) were identified in lymphocytes exposed to 0.1 and 0.08 mg/mL of the pristine CNT. N-doped CNT, induced dicentric chromosomes and chromosomal rings. There was significant difference in the percentage of SCE of cells treated with doped NTC versus negative control and pristine NTC (p<0.0001). Conclusion: the highest concentration of pristine CNTs induced the most chromatid and chromosomal damage. Although the percentage was less than 10%, such degree of damage is considered harmful to cells. Lymphocytes treated with N-doped CNT presented lower percentages of CA and high percentage of SCE, which shows a greater repair of genetic material with these compounds. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The experiments were monitored by pH measurements and mineralogical analyses of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Vaterite was the predominant polymorph in the precipitates after 6 days of the process. However, a considerable proportion of calcite appeared (above 30%) when the tryptone concentration was 0.4% or below. Additionally, the other experiments had a similar precipitate formation (between 3.2-3.6 g/L) except the assay using 0.2% of tryptone, which presented a low calcium carbonate production (1.79 g/L). A tryptone concentration below 0.4% would limit the bacterial metabolism and CO2 formation, necessary for calcium carbonate production. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Prediction of pile settlement is considered as a highly complex task by geotechnical engineering researchers and professionals, owing to the diversity of prediction methods and also to the difficulty to use predictive models that represent the nonlinear behavior of the soil. In this sense, this work assesses two methods for nonlinear prediction of the settlement of a 23-m long, 31-cm diameter instrumented root pile tested via slow maintained load (SML) test. The local subsoil is composed of colluvional silty-sandy, lateritic clay with a collapsible surface layer (6.5 m), followed by silty clayey sandy soil (diabase residue) down to 20 m. The results showed that the models of nonlinear behavior were in appropriate agreement with the experimentally obtained results. It was also noted that, for small displacements of the top (5.1 mm), the tip load increased continuously from its reaction to the final stage of the test. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Atrazine is one of the most often used herbicides in the world. It reaches the surface water body by runoff, direct application or airborne dispersal. Conventional water treatment methods do not efficiently remove these types of pollutants, whereas granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption is an adequate technique for the removal of organic compounds from water. In this work, the Atrazine reduction of water doped with two concentrations of Atrazine, was evaluated during the conventional treatment process (coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and sand and anthracite filtration), followed by double filtration with two adsorbent granular media (vegetal and mineral GAC), which resulted in an efficient reduction of UV254 (86%) and Atrazine (99%). \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

NDVI was used to identify problems in the development and growth of FEDEARROZ-2000. FEDEARROZ-2000 is a variety of rice, which is resistant to the \u201choja blanca\u201d virus and direct \u201csogata\u201d damage that affect fields in tropical America. The temporal dynamics of the NDVI for FEDEARROZ-2000 were estimated. An NDVI lower than 0.8 in the Stage of Rice Panicle Development (SRPD) was related to areas with levelling problems, differences in the vegetative stage, water stress, and spacing between plants. The NDVI for the SRPD had a significant positive correlation with yield, 1,000 grain weight and the number of panicles (Pearson's R\u22650.86; probability value P \u22640.04). NDVI mapping at milky stage helped to identify production environments and to schedule the harvest areas. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The global context on climate change and Colombia\u2019s recent international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, are an opportunity to encourage projects in sustainable mobility. In this study, indicators associated to trips attraction and carbon dioxide (CO2) avoidance were estimated for measures related to bicycle use. Such indicators were then applied in different scenarios for two Colombian cities. For the assessed measures, the construction of dedicated bike-paths is the one with a greater trip-attraction indicator (455 trips / km of infrastructure-day). The CO2 emissions reduction potential significantly changes among the studied measures and with the size of the city, the results for this indicator ranged between 92 gCO2/trip up to 810 gCO2/trip. These indicators represent a simple and flexible tool to have a first approximation to the mitigation potential of active transport projects in the context of Latin America cities. For instance, when an ex-ante evaluation is needed as an initial requirement for access to climate change finance funds. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Hemicellulose analyses were performed after delignification with sodium chlorite and extraction with 18% NaOH and 24% KOH containing 0.26 M NaBH4. The main components of hemicellulose were identified via FTIR and NMR spectroscopy, and monomeric sugars were identified via HPLC. Hemicellulose A composed of arabinoxylans, glucomannans and arabinogalactactans and hemicellulose B primarily composed of arabinoxylans were extracted. The hemicelluloses of the Colombian varieties were more stable against heat than those of the Venezuelan variety. The results of this project allowed discovery of the potential use of agricultural sugarcane residues for bioethanol production because they have a holocellulose content of more than 60%. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "There are situations where the knowledge of thermodynamic properties such as thermal conductivity for the present case is required. In some of them an additional requirement appears, as the measurement has to be made along the three perpendicular space axes. In the present article, three thermal conductivities that appear in orthotropic materials were predicted by solving an inverse heat transfer problem. This inverse problem was solved using the Cuckoo algorithm, the deterministic Levenberg-Marquardt, and with the new hybrid of these two. It was found that these three strategies produce excellent results when compared to each other. Nevertheless, the hybrid algorithm proved to be more efficient than its precursors in solving the present problem. The hybrid algorithm consumed in average less computing time compared to the metaheuristic algorithm and extended the search range in comparison to the deterministic one, always maintaining precision in its results. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Besides the mathematical procedure presented in a previous paper, an electronic system was also designed and implemented, in order to inject superimposed controlled pulses to the power system (50/60 Hz) wave. The results show improved performance of the wavelet transform compared to that of the Fourier Transform, for transient signal analysis to be applied on a nonintrusive transformer monitoring approach. Particularly, this new approach proves useful in overcoming problems related to signal filtering and signal processing in an online frequency-response analysis of a transformer diagnosis. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This study evaluated the double filtration technology with two types of Granular Activated Carbon (GAC: vegetable-coconut and mineral-bituminous shells, respectively), to determine its influence in reducing turbidity and mainly dissolved organic matter (UV254). We used filtered water from a Conventional Water Treatment Plant (WTP) and the second filtration stage were made using continuous flow gravity columns at laboratory-scale with different percentages of GAC:sand (100:0, 80:20, 50:50, 30:70, and 0:100). While the sand filter presented the best turbidity removal efficiency, the CAG filters were more efficient at UV254 removal, being most efficient the filters with greater percentage of GAC. The results demonstrate that the use of double filtration technology with GAC can be an efficient alternative for the removal of organic matter to obtain safe drinking water. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Adequate operation regions were defined over the map based on visual inspection results of bead-on-plate welds and the establishment of instability boundaries. Some examples were analyzed by locating two common parameters for industrial welding qualification (current and voltage) and drawing the limits established by AWS D1.1:2015 code for these essential variables (\u00b17% PQR voltage and \u00b110% PQR amperage) on the frequency map.

This paper presents the hysteresis characterization and modeling of the Tekscan A201-1 FSR employing the Preisach Operator (PO) function. In order to compensate for hysteresis during sensor operation, the inverse PO was numerically found on the basis of the Closest Match Algorithm (CMA). A test bench, capable of handling sixteen sensors simultaneously, was built, which allowed the characterization and later testing of the CMA. Grip force profiles were applied to the sensors during testing and the experimental results showed a considerable reduction in the force estimation error compared with the linear regression method proposed by the manufacturer. These results enable a wider use of FSRs in applications with tight accuracy requirements. Finally, a generalized sensor model for hysteresis compensation that simplifies the obtaining of PO parameters is presented. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a model for the evaluation of strategies in the management of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). Waste represents a risk to public health and the environment, the dangerous type compounds that constitute them and the increase of their generation. In Colombia, there is a law of 1672 guidelines for the adoption of a policy that improves the management of WEEE. This Law proposes public management objectives, of which in this article three of them were evaluated (Reduction in generation, incentive to use, promote integrated participation). For this evaluation, a model was built using the Dynamics of Systems methodology, which allowed the establishment of the socio-environmental system structure for the generation and management of WEEE. Likewise, the evaluation scenarios were defined, the first is the initial or natural state that corresponds to the system without any strategy and the second is the system with the implementation of the strategies, which were divided into two groups. One is Economic Circular Strategies, Environmental Education and Job Promotion, and the other group contains the producer's extended liability strategies, citizenship incentives and the collection rate. Model simulations and scenario comparisons showed that the first group of strategies decreased in the generation rate of WEEE. Likewise, they allowed a second group of strategies on disposition rate. Likewise, the proposed model for the management of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment is useful for the evaluation of waste management strategies in different scenarios. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "One problem in the post-harvest phase of apples is the mechanical impact damage. Its identification prevents quality issues during storage. The objective was to identify the wavelengths at which damage is detected early in apples of the 'Fuji' cultivar. Damage was simulated with a controlled stroke and taking hyperspectral images from 400 to 1700 nm. Three experiments were carried out at different temperatures (4 and 20 \u00b0 C) and with varying sampling times. It was found that the NIR zone ranging between 1050 and 1100 nm allows to classify healthy and bruised zones by means of a discriminant analysis by partial least squares (PLS-DA). Additionally, the evolution of the damage over time was not significant for the classification of the pixels (healthy and bruised classes), since bumps were detected in all three experiments from the first time. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The analyses are performed by means of linear static analysis using finite element modelling. Firstly, flat plates under transverse loading (uniform and non-uniform-trapezoidal) are modelled to validate the computational model against analytical solutions available in the literature. Secondly, the behavior of unstiffened curves plates under transverse loading is analyzed. Then, the influence of both, transversal and longitudinal stiffening in controlling the out-of-plane displacements and stresses distribution of the curve plates is demonstrated. Finally, a case-study concerning the response of a hydroelectric power plant intake gates subjected to a hydrostatic head is further investigated. The results show that the increase in gate stiffness is reflected in smaller deformations implying a better performance and system integrity. \u00a9 The author.",

The results were compared to those obtained with two mineral oils of contrasting viscosity, namely technical white mineral oil and delta 360 plasticizer, neither of them containing additives. Sweet almond oil was found to have greater lubricity than the mineral oils, as the spheres it lubricated had lower average wear track diameter and friction coefficient. In addition, sweet almond oil showed better performance under extreme pressure conditions and a greater weld point than mineral oils.

    "Abstract": "From the perspective of heavy vehicles stability, some criteria of stability should be adhered to highway designs. In particular, the relationship between minimum radius, superelevation, slope angle, side friction, and design speed should be re-evaluated. In this regard, the static rollover threshold (SRT) is one of the most important factors used to define the stability of vehicles. This factor is highly dependent on the maximum lateral acceleration (ay) of a vehicle until it reaches the rollover threshold. This acceleration in turn is dependent on the vehicle speed and the radius of curvature. Taking into account the stability of vehicles, in this study the highways design is evaluated and compared with the classic design criterion. This study also suggests that in order to ensure driving safety, the State Highway Agencies should make a reevaluation of existing speed limits and the design of highway curves. \u00a9 The author.",

Calculations are carried out through the Full-Potential Linear Augmented Plane Wave method (FP-LAPW) within the framework of the Density Functional Theory (DFT) with exchange and correlation effects in the Generalized Gradient (GGA) and Local Density (LDA) approximations, including spin polarization. From the minimization of energy as a function of volume using the Murnaghan\u2019s state equation the equilibrium lattice parameter and cohesive properties of this compound were obtained. The study of the electronic structure was based in the analysis of the electronic density of states (DOS), and the band structure, showing that this compound evidences an effective magnetic moment of 3.0 \u00b5B. The pressure and temperature dependence of specific heat, entropy, thermal expansion coefficient, Debye temperature and Gr\u00fcneisen parameter were calculated by DFT from the state equation using the quasi-harmonic model of Debye.

In this work, the simulation of an industrial grate boiler is done in three stages, one for the primary air circuit, another one for the secondary air circuit and the final one is the furnace. The combustion of sugarcane bagasse is a complex phenomenon that involves moisture vaporization, devolatilization and char combustion, in order to account for those phenomena, bagasse particles were modeled in a Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. The simulations were performed in commercial software ANSYS FLUENT and the devolatilization model were programmed in C language as a User Defined Function (UDF). When the results of the simulations were compared with experimental data, a satisfactory agreement was observed. Simulations were performed with primary and secondary air inlets modifications in order to optimize the boiler performance, the results of those simulations showed significant improvement in the combustion parameters. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "From the Chezy-Manning equation, considered valid for the \"steady state\" of a natural channel, as an extension of the condition of \"uniform flow,\" it is interesting to determine the degree of variation of the average flow velocity, depending on the variations of the factors involved. That is why this article presents a theoretical analysis which yields a first approximation of the sensitivity of the variation of the magnitude of the average speed to changes in the geometry or geomorphology of a section of the channel. It is found that the concept of \"stable state\" for the thermodynamic state of a natural channel can be assimilated to that of \"dynamic equilibrium,\" in which the values of the state parameters vary slowly, in a \"regional\" sense. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Strawberry (Fragaria ananassa), blackberry (Rubus glaucus), Peruvian cherry (Physalis peruviana L.) and purple passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims) are important fruit crops in Colombia, due to their organoleptic properties and nutritional qualities, making them attractive for international markets. This study was undertaken to characterize the physicochemical properties of these four fruits and to present an alternative for their use. To achieve this goal, the moisture, pH, soluble solids, acidity, color, iron and vitamin C concentration were determined, and a fortified mixed fruit drink was developed. All of the fruits can be classified as high acidity products due to the acidity results. Purple passion fruit and Peruvian cherry presented the highest content of soluble solids, while blackberry, purple passion fruit and Peruvian cherry did not exhibit statistically significant differences in their iron contents, and strawberry exhibited the highest contribution of vitamin C. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Compared to conventional concrete, high-performance concrete production offers such benefits as greater ease of placement, smaller sections, improved finishing and higher strength and durability. For the design of these types of concretes, it is advisable to carry out studies on pastes or mortars in order to evaluate admixture - cementitious material compatibility. This evaluation entails verifying fresh state properties and evolution over time. The aim of this work is to evaluate the behavior of mortars made with different water reducers as well as binary and ternary cements, and their connection to the properties they acquire in hardened state. Fluidity in the fresh state and absorption, density and compressive strength in the hardened state were evaluated. The results show that the impact of superplasticizers is not restricted to the fresh state, as influence on the development of the degree of hydration and compacity can also be noticed. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a useful model to determine the washing periods and to indicate the pollution levels of electrical insulators. The behavior of leakage current, which is one indicator of the presence of pollutants on the insulator surfaces, was characterized through a regression model. We quantitatively examine the behavior of leakage current and the way electrical components are polluted. The data for environmental variables and leakage current in an electrical substation are analyzed and a model is identified that well represents the leakage current behavior on the insulators. Through this model, some predictions of the pollution effect can be made using analysis tools that enable the identification of the effects of leakage current on the entire network. This method can be used to obtain leakage current models on electrical substations located in highly polluted zones. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The ICC was constructed with a combination of two analytical methodologies: Pressure-State-Response (PER) indicators and fuzzy logic from artificial intelligence. One pressure indicator, three statuses and two response indicators were defined. Each indicator is associated with a fuzzy logic function. For the operation of the index, 234 decision rules were generated, which were programmed in the MATLAB program. The index was applied to the tropical Andean microcuenca Chocho located in the Department of Valle del Cauca in Colombia. With the application of the ICC index in this micro-basin, the high level of vulnerability of this microwatershed was evidenced in the low, medium and high zone. The ICC is a support for the decision making by different actors of the micro-watershed. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

CUC of irrigation units was measured every 20 h up to operation time of 160 h. Results showed that drip emitters G2 and G3 were the most suitable for the application of cashew nut wastewater, and the operating pressure of 140 kPa minimized clogging in drip emitters G1, G2 and G3 when operated with cashew nut wastewater. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The impact of the modeling conditions the calibration process, which consisted of adjusting the kinetic constant reaeration (ka), deoxygenation (kd) and total removal of the BOD (kr), using the GLUE methodology, through Monte Carlo simulations. The study shows that ka is greater than (kd), a condition indicating a high potential for self-purification, while high values of kr are attributed to shallow low-depth currents, demonstrating that they are relatively simple systems to biodegrade. Finally, the performance analysis of the OD and BOD showed differences less than 10% for the Streeter-Phelps model and more than 50% for QUAL2K software, due to the lack of information required by the model of ka and kr. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This zone is particularly important in beach systems, as here erosion and accretion of the coastline and coastal inundation occur; therefore, understanding of the dynamics in this zone allows the prediction and mitigation of potential impacts on beaches, dunes and coastal structures under different climate scenarios. In situ measurements of variables such as pressure, velocity and sediment concentrations on the swash were carried out for the first time at two beaches in the Colombian Caribbean: Costa Verde beach, (Ci\u00e9naga) and Hollywood beach (Cartagena). The data were used to compare the velocity and sediments transport patterns in the swash zone due to the beach slope on this zone and to the influence of different wave frequencies (IG or SS). In addition, a first approximation to link small spatio-temporal scales (swash cycles) with larger spatio-temporal processes (erosion-accretion) was carried out. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Selecting optimal cutting parameters is a very important task in any machining process planning, especially when sustainability is in the sight. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization focused on sustainable productions, for selecting optimal cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut) in multi-pass cylindrical turning operations. Both, the economic and environmental pillars of sustainability are considered as optimization targets. Technical requirements, such as cutting power, forces and surface roughness, are also taken into account as constraints. Optimization was carried out through a posteriori approach, where a set of non-dominated solutions, also known as Pareto front, were obtained and, then, the most suitable combination of targets is selected for the specific workshop conditions. Two gradient-free optimization techniques were used for carrying out the optimization: the non-sorting genetic algorithm II and the multi-objective particle swarm optimization. A study case was carried out not only for evaluating the fitness of the proposed approach but also for comparing the performance of the considered techniques. The outcomes showed a better performance by the genetic algorithms, in both the computational efficiency and the quality of the obtained Pareto front. The proposed approach demonstrated its convenience for sustainability optimization of machining processes, giving a simpler way for analyzing simultaneously the economic and environmental aspects of sustainability. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "There are around 9 million tons of sugarcane crop residue per year in Colombia that are not recovered but they have potential to make value-added products. It is necessary to know the residue components, especially those from hemicellulose, to clarify the type of process to obtain the hemicellulose monosaccharides and isolate them efficiently. In order to separate pure hemicelluloses, five processes of extraction from tops and leaves of CC 8592, CC 8475, and V 7151 sugarcane varieties were studied. After evaluating exposure to dewaxing using ethanol and chloroform-methanol mixtures, residues were subjected to different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and acidified sodium chlorite to achieve delignification. Additionally, procedures of extraction were developed with sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and precipitation. Chloroform-methanol dewaxing and sodium chlorite with sodium borohydride delignification allowed to achieve the highest extraction yield, with hemicellulose recovery ranging from 0.20-0.34 g hemicellulose/g dry residue in the varieties studied. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, the problem of payload oscillations in tower-cranes subject to parametric uncertainties and external disturbances through a discrete-time Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) scheme is addressed. In the proposed control scheme, state and disturbance estimations are provided by an extended state observer which incorporates a resonant internal model designed to improve disturbance/state estimations specially those coming from the payload oscillation. Then, the control law is designed to reject the disturbances on-line and accommodate the closed-loop system dynamics. The control proposal is experimentally validated on a small-scale tower-crane, and compared to an observer-based PI controller and other ADRC scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed control scheme provides improved attenuation in the oscillations of the payload and exhibits substantial improvements in disturbance rejection properties. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Prioritization of those plans tends to be based on assessment of production indicators, leaving aside key logistic aspects such as transportation, handling, packing among others. Due to this reason, this work proposes a multi-criteria methodology, based on experts\u2019 method and planning method of technological development in agro-industrial chains proposed by ISNAR, which estimate logistic potential index (LPi) and level of competitiveness index (LCi). Joint analysis of both indicators allowed to prioritize products in an array called the prioritization matrix.

Those constitutive models are used to recommend them for subsequent application in seismic site-response analysis in effective stresses. The performance of the three-coupled models were evaluated using a database of 25 selected high quality cyclic simple shear tests. The conducted analysis suggested that the simple Coupled GMP and stress-strain constitutive model reasonably capture PWP behavior observed in the laboratory tests, they are analyzed better than using advanced constitutive models, and all of them can be used to perform effective stress-based one-dimensional site-response analysis. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Considering the security requirements, it is necessary to evaluate the fire resistance of vertical sealing systems. Within the scope of habitability, the standard specifies that these systems must have an adequate acoustic performance. Regarding this scenario, this study has the purpose of evaluate the performance of two non-structural vertical sealing systems in ceramic bricks by comparing two different layouts of horizontal air gaps. Therefore, laboratory tests were performed, following the prescriptions of NBR 10636 (ABNT, 1989) and ISO 10140-2 (ISO, 2010). It was verified that the system with higher air gaps number had a better performance on fire resistance, and that the acoustic performance was very similar between the two systems. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Each treatment and the control had four replicates. Plant height, stem diameter, leaf area and shoot dry matter accumulation of cotton were evaluated at 130 days after emergence (DAE), whereas seed cotton weight was evaluated at 135 DAE. Our findings indicate that the use of treated domestic sewage for 100% ETC replacement promotes greater gains of weight and growth in colored cotton without the need for K fertilization, evidencing the potential of wastewater for colored cotton for sustainable agriculture. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In a mining context, production scheduling\u2019s main objective is to determine the best mining sequence of blocks to achieve the largest net present value and to maximize ore reserve exploitation. Stockpiling and blending procedures may represent very helpful alternatives for mine planning to ensure the ore quality and amount required by the processing plant. In order to satisfy industrial requirements of grades and tones, reducing stockpile fluctuations may represent a very important tool especially for medium and short term mine planning. Classical linear programing has been widely used to model blending problems at the mining industry, however this formulation allows only one objective formulation. The current work describes a system based on goal programing able to reach blending constraints desired by short/medium term planning. The proposed formulation achieves the best schedule scenario, ensuring cost constrains are respected. Hence, this study aims to provide support for both short and long term mine planning. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Then, fruits were stored at room temperature (25 \u00b1 1.0\u00b0C) for 12 days. Every three days, evaluations of mass loss, length, diameter, color of peel and pulp, pulp firmness, total soluble solids, pH and vitamin C content were held. The experiment was completely randomized in a 4 x 5 factorial design with four concentrations of the solutions and five storage periods with three replications. The results showed that cassava starch and pectin-based coatings can be an alternative for maintaining the post-harvest quality of \"Paluma\" guavas. Concentrations of 4 and 6% of both types of coating provided good results regarding the retention of some attributes.

These procedures do not allow verification of the estimated parameters; therefore, this paper presents the formulation of a more practical, useful and accurate methodology which is achieved based upon the determination of characteristic features found on the pressure and pressure derivative versus time log-log plot with the purpose of developing analytical expressions for the interpretation of interference tests under spherical and linear flow conditions. These equations were successfully verified by their application on synthetic tests. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "There are not methods for direct biobased synthesis of caprolactam (CPL), the combination of biotechnological production of renewable raw materials with physical and chemical modifications are emerging and showing promising results. Among these raw materials there are some acids: adipic, glucaric, glutamic, levulinic, succinic, muconic, 2,5-furanicarboxylic, 6-aminocaproic; and other compounds: adiponitrile, lysine, 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-butanediol, Hydroxymethylfurfural, adipic semialdehyde, benzene, phenol and ethanol. There are barriers that have not allowed the viability and commercial development of these processes, such as limitations on the fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass, high-energy requirements for separation of products, low yield, biological inhibition, limited chemical selectivity and low purity of products. Research and development efforts of any of these processes were not identified in Colombia. The route through the lysine is the most promising by involving few reaction stages, by having economic raw materials and because it is carried out under moderate operating conditions. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Despite standard Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models having been widely used in assessing efficiency in education, a few studies use Network DEA (NDEA) models in educational evaluation. In this paper, we proposed an alternative to the official evaluation performed every three years by CAPES (Brazilian agency for post-graduation programs regulation) using an NDEA model. The use of NDEA is justified because depending on the point of view, some variables can be considered either inputs or outputs. The use of NDEA avoids the need to decide whether a variable is an input or output of the entire process. This happens because a variable can be both an output for one stage and an input for another. Our relational NDEA model computes both productivity and quality assessments together with global efficiency using bibliometric data. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The modified starches presented dextrose equivalents (DE) ranging between 13 and 92%, yield (Y) between 0 and 45.5%. The Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis showed that the granules suffered exo-corrosion in agreement with the degree of hydrolysis. The crystallinity degree increased following modification. The granule morphology of hydrolyzed starch was different compared to the native starch. The gelatinization temperature in the residues of hydrolyzed cassava starches hydrolyzed increased with the crystallinity degree as well with the reduction in the amylose content. The native starch showed a greater setback and amylose values than hydrolyzed starches, which indicates that it is more susceptible to retrogradation or water lost (syneresis). \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This algorithm was tested with 863 records of earthquakes, where the input parameters were an exponential function of waveform envelope estimated by least squares and maximum value of recorded waveforms for each component of the seismic station. Cross validation was applied to normalized polynomial kernel functions, obtaining mean absolute error for different exponents and complexity parameters. The epicenter distance was estimated with 10.3 kilometers of absolute error, improving the results previously obtained for this hypocentral parameter. The proposed algorithm is easy to implement in hardware and can be employed directly in the field, generating fast decisions at seismological control centers increasing the possibilities of effective reactions. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The glow plasma produced in the region between the electrodes and the chamber wall of a cathodic arc was modeled. The plasma behavior was characterized for different cathode materials that are commonly used in a cathodic arc deposition. The electron temperature, density, and electric potential were found to decrease as function of the distance from the spot region. However, the ion kinetic energy tends to increase due to the acceleration of the ions coming from the bulk region. Our results show that the cathodic arc is not directly affected by the plasma potential of the glow plasma and that the cathode material has an important influence on the plasma behavior, mainly because of the electrical and thermal conductivity of each material. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Most microorganisms that are considered as probiotics have received much attention in recent scientific research, supporting their important role in improving bowel function in both human and animal health. Probiotics have the ability to modulate the immune system of the host, compete for colonization with pathogenic microorganisms and improve digestion of food. One disadvantage in the use of probiotics in food processing is the low viability of probiotics that may be affected by environmental conditions including air, humidity and temperature. An alternative to avoid these effects is by developing protective conditions that ensure the viability and activity of these microorganisms during use and food application, ensuring they are released into the intestine where their action is required. Accordingly, this study aims to assess the influence of spray drying technique with maltodextrin and inulin on viability of a consortium of three types of probiotic bacteria widely used in the food industry. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The proposed model comprises six phases: (i) image conversion from the conventional space into the Cartesian complex space; (ii) greyscale transformation, (iii) super-pixel space production based on watershed transform, (iv) texture space production taking advantage of 1-dimensional interpixel elements, (v) classification using support vector machines and (vi) results quality assessment. Although global accuracy of the proposed classification improves accuracy of results obtained with a conventional representation of space, the confidence test shows that this improvement is not statistically significant.

In this study, two groups of Glulam beams were fabricated and experimentally analyzed: 30 non reinforced Glulam beams and 30 Glulam beams reinforced with punched metal plates. All Glulam beams were made of Carbonero (Licania campestre) and an epoxy adhesive with high strength and durability. Four-point bending tests in the 60 full-scale beams were carried out. Then, a model based on linear elasticity theory was used to calculate the strength and verify the experimental results. It was determined that Glulam beams reinforced with punched metal plates show a better mechanical behavior than non reinforced Glulam beams. It was further established that the use of punched metal plates increases the homogeneity and the mechanical capacity of Glulam beams. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Polyvinyl Difluoride and Hypophosphorous Acid (PVDF/H3PO2) membranes were prepared with different concentrations of acid. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results showed a typical step of the glass transition around 250 K. Two endothermic anomalies were observed: one closed to 357.6 K due to the evaporation of water, and another closed to 422 K attributed to the melting of the crystalline phase of PVDF. The mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) reveal the possible presence of (C2H2O) and hydrofluoric acid (HF) molecules, thereby raises the possibility that H3PO2 lost a hydrogen atom and bonded to the polymer chain of the PVDF by displacing an atom of fluorine. The presence of water molecules at different temperatures suggests the formation of superficial, internal and structural water in the polymer-acid system. This feature makes the PVDF/H3PO2 system to be proposed as solid electrolyte in fuel cells. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Over the past decade, bike-sharing systems (BSS) and Bike-sharing programs (BSP) have been implemented around the globe due to their benefits and for changing the established paradigm that the car is the main mode of transportation in urban areas. For that reason, one of the most important elements that needs careful planning is the location of the bike stations. This research evaluates the location of the BSP bike stations in a small Colombian city based on the location of the system\u2019s users. Additionally, two alternatives are shown to achieve a better understanding of how the BSP could be well planned and consolidated. The results were obtained with a location-allocation model which assigns each user with an impedance value from each station. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Irrigation effects of produced water treatment, diluted in underground water, were analyzed through the chemical characteristics of argisol with foraging palm. Assay was performed in a randomized block design (RBD), with five replications, in a subdivided split plot scheme. Splits comprised treatments T1 (100% underground water-UW, control), T2 (75% UW and 25% produced water treatment-PW), T3 (50% UW and 50% PW), T4 (25% UW and 75% PW) and T5 (100% PW), whilst sub splits comprised soil depths (0-0.10 m and 0.10-0.20 m). The results showed that irrigation with diluted treated water produced no risk of soil salinization. There was evidence of leaching of the mobile ions to the deeper layer of soil, especially sodium and magnesium. The highest risk of sodification was observed for soil irrigated only with groundwater (T1-control treatment). \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The present work reports the microstructure, physical and mechanical properties of a material composed of kaolin, diatomite and calcium carbonate reinforcement (CaCO3). The ceramic prototypes were shaped by the slip casting method and sintered at temperatures between 800 \u00b0C and 1100 \u00b0C. The morphology and average pore size was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and the mineralogical phases were determined by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The apparent density was established by the mercury immersion method according to the E \u2013 8B Standard of the Institute of Ceramic Technology (ITC); the percentage of absorption was determined by the boiling method according to ISO 10545-3 standard; linear contraction was studied in three directions: long, wide and high. The study of the mechanical resistance to compression followed the procedure established at ASTM C773\u201388 standard and the breaking modulus was calculated by the three-point bending test, according to ISO 10545\u20134. Results show that the material structure is affected with increasing temperature reporting a decrease in quartz phase from 51.16 % to 33.81 %. Percentage of absorption revealed its most significant variation between 950 \u00b0C and 1100 \u00b0C with a decrease of 21 % approximately. Mechanical resistance values showed wide dispersion which was attributed to the different orientations in which the material failed during each test. According to the pore diameters found, the compound is characterized by being macro and mesoporous facilitating its application in catalysis, photochemistry, microelectronics and other microfiltration media. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In Colombia, sugarcane represents the second product with a large area of cultivation. It is estimated that from sugar mills about 6 million tons of sugarcane bagasse, SCB, are produced, of which 5 million are inefficiently used for burning boilers. SCB is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, allowing its use as a potential adsorbent. Particularly, the aim of this work was to evaluate the viability of using SCB for the adsorption of basic red 46, BR46, in aqueous solution. The effect of factors such as point of zero charge, solution pH, particle size, adsorbent dosage, initial dye concentration, contact time and ionic strength was evaluated using a statistical design of experiments. A removal of 86.4 % was obtained and the further optimization of the process through a response surface design, allowed to achieve a maximum adsorption of 95.0 %. These results suggest SCB is a promising alternative of a non-conventional adsorbent that could be applied for treating dyed effluents. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Using a 3D printed device and a red LED, here we tested the feasibility of using a smartphone ambient light sensor (ALS) to estimate leaf chlorophyll by light transmission. Its performance was evaluated by comparing 30 leaf sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) transmission readings of the red LED (663 nm) obtained from the smartphone and a standard spectrometer, which showed a good coefficient of determination (r2 = 0.9067). Additionally, a comparison between the ALS and a SPAD 502\u2122 (a commercial device for chlorophyll content estimation) was made with chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflora Tzvelev) leaves, obtaining a good correlation between both measurements. Light transmission was also measured in S. bicolor flag leaves from plants growing in the greenhouse under increasing nitrogen fertilization. A clear fit between leaf light transmission and plant height was also observed, suggesting a simple, smartphone based estimation of plant\u2019s chlorophyll. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Disposal of solid wastes has become a common problem for public administrations due to the high population growth rates and the unavailability of land in large cities. Besides, the increase of long-term rainfalls combined with poor runoff water collection systems in sanitary landfills causes greater production of leachate at the disposal sites. This paper examines the impact of solid wastes leachates on a tropical soil throughout the geotechnical characterization of two samples of residual soil, both sharing the same origin, one of them exposed to the effect of solid wastes leachates for over 15 years and the other one in natural soil conditions (uncontaminated). For this purpose, various laboratory tests were carried out to determinate the physical, chemical, structural, mechanical and mineralogical properties of soil samplings. The results suggest that the exposition of the contaminated sample to leachates modify significantly their physical, chemical, structural, hydro-mechanical and mineralogical properties, showing a degradation of the geotechnical behavior of soils exposed to contaminants. These should serve to raise awareness in environmental authorities about the inadequate disposal of solid wastes and other contaminants thrown directly into the soil. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The use of laminated composite materials has increased in modern engineering, mainly in those projects that require an assurance of good strength and durability. It has been found that some properties of the material that ensure proper performance can be affected by the occurrence of residual stresses caused by the manufacturing process. In this paper, the influence of thermal residual stresses on the free vibration of reinforced plates is analyzed. For the experimental study, a square, reinforced, prepreg laminate was used. The laminate was reinforced using two different types of reinforcement: lateral and perimetral. The plates were prepared using two different techniques. The first group of laminates was prepared by curing the reinforcement at 177 \u00b0C. The second group of laminates was prepared by secondary bonding of the reinforcement to the laminate at room temperature (22 \u00b0C). A numerical model was elaborated for comparison with the experimental results. Accuracy was observed when comparing experimental and numerical results, showing that the presence of residual thermal stress affects the value of the natural frequencies of free vibration and the characteristic modal form of reinforced plates. Regardless of the type of reinforcement used, a notable increase in these values was observed, even when the element was simply supported. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This paper performed an analysis and assessment to identify the factors, variables and indicators of resilience for sustainable UDS management by using an information management tool for scientific subjects. As a result of this analysis, four water resource resilience factors were identified: i. Flexibility; ii. Resourcefulness; iii. Redundancy; and iv. Robustness. In addition, six UDS resilience variables were identified: i. Recovery capacity; ii. Response capacity; iii. Amplitude; iv. Absorption capacity; v. Resistance capacity; and vi. Response curve. Corresponding indicators were proposed to quantify these variables. The identified elements contribute to the development of integrated frameworks to assess UDS resilience. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, vibration analysis and Gaussian Processes techniques are used in useful life prognostics of ball bearings. The database is provided by The Prognostics Data Repository from NASA, and shows the failure evolution in ball bearings. The data basis also provides training and validation data sets for ball bearing useful life prediction. Several time and frequency characteristics are extracted from ball bearing vibration signals for trending analysis, and finally one of these is taken as input for the Gaussian process and describe, with a probabilistic strategy, the failure evolution system. No dimensionality reduction algorithm is used in this paper, only the evaluation of trends in failure evolution is taken for decision. This data basis was used in 2012 IEEE classification contest. Several participants used classification techniques based on time-frequency transformation and Artificial Intelligence algorithms but none of them used Gaussian Processes in a classification scheme. Although, the present work does not have the best results in classification it does show a major simplicity in formulation and implementation than most of the classification schemes. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backpropagation neural network and a support vector machine (SVM) were trained to recognize three types of PD patterns. Experimental results showed that the algorithms can achieve high recognition rates. Moreover, the Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was used to denoise PD signals as a prior stage to the classification process. Different mother wavelets were tested for different levels of decomposition in order to find appropriate wavelet parameters for better signal to noise ratio (SNR) and less distortion after the denoising process. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Material removal mechanisms, as well as its impact on burr formation and control are reviewed, followed by a case study through the application of gaseous cooling based on vortex tubes. Different vortex generator configurations were tested, proving to be fast response an economically-friendly alternative for burr reduction while micro-milling biopolymers.

    "Abstract": "Based on the decision to automate the solution of an optimization problem related to the selection of an \"N\" number of geological exploration wells in a reservoir, which reflects the general characteristics of the well and having the mathematical models created for that purpose, arises the need to look for some alternative that allows to obtain the solutions of the raised problem. The mathematical models created generate a system formed by an objective function, several constraints in the form of inequalities and an additional restriction, in the form of equality: a classic problem of selection. This type of problem has solutions of non-polynomial computational complexity; for this reason, instead of implementing complex algorithms, it was decided to design an automated tool based on the use of genetic algorithms. An automated application was created for the solution of the problem of selection of a described mining sample, being able to implement a low complexity computational solution. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This study describes the development and formulation of a novel mathematical model for coal flotation kinetic. The flotation rate was considered as a function of chemical, operating and petrographic parameters for a global flotation order n. The equation for flotation rate was obtained by dimensional analysis using the Rayleigh method. It shows the dependency of flotation kinetic on operating parameters, such as air velocity and particle size; chemical parameters, such as reagents dosage and solids content; and mineral and maceral composition of coal. The flotation rate equation integrates the kinetic coefficient and the intrinsic characteristics of coal with dimensional consistency, and it is expressed by three dimensionless numbers which have physical chemical meaning. The model also exhibits similarities with traditional transport phenomena models represented by dimensionless numbers and predicts the flotation kinetic constant of a Colombian coal sample showing a good correlation between experimental and calculated values. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Numerical simulations were carried out by Jets et Poudres software, and the results obtained were used to deposit hydroxyapatite coatings through oxyfuel flame spraying process, in order to improve its adhesion onto Ti6Al4V substrates. The effect of a neutral, an oxidizing and a super-oxidizing flames, as well as the spray distance between the substrate and the torch (7, 9.5 and 12 cm), on dimensionless K-Sommerfeld (K) number was determined. The dimensionless number is highly influenced by the spraying distance, while an effect of the flame type was not evident. The Sommerfeld number in coatings manufactured at 12 cm is between 34 and 37 and the homogeneity in their structure is higher than in those sprayed at 7 and 9.5 cm, in which unmelted particles (K=0) or splashing (K\u02c375) were observed, decreasing the adhesion of coatings. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This research found that the sowing speed has a proportional relationship with: a) the percentage of plants grouped in their roots, b) the number of non-productive tillers, c) the fuel consumed rate, d) uncovered seed, e) effective field capacity. The sowing speed of 5.13 \u00b1 0.18 km/h was achieved by plants with a higher number of panicles per m2 and yield: this is optimal. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Biowaste is the main fraction of MSW in developing countries. Composting is a promising alternative for the management of biowaste in these contexts. However, its implementation has not been effective in developing countries, for which it is necessary to explore options to improve its application in this context. This article reviewed the research trends on biowaste composting and the potential application in developing countries such as Colombia. For this purpose, the technology monitoring methodology was used in databases of specialized scientific journals (period 2006 to 2017), using bibliometric tools such as RefViz\u00ae and Tlab\u00ae. The research has focused on optimizing the process through measures such as the use of amendment or support materials, strategies for reducing nitrogen losses, aerobic biodegradability studies and the development of empirical models to predict process conditions. The integration of this research in the context of developing countries can contribute to improve the application of biowaste composting. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

These clones were characterized by their physicochemical properties followed by their fermentation process. The behavior of temperature, pH, total acidity, total polyphenols and fermentation index was recorded. Additionally, the physical cutting test was carried out at the end of the process, as well as the sensory evaluation of the cocoa liquor, in order to establish the sensory profile of each material. Results showed that fermentation time for clones ICS 95, ICS 01 was five days, being the latter a regular type. The other three clones ICS 39, TSH 565 and CCN 51 required six days of fermentation but a premium cocoa was obtained.

    "Abstract": "Simulations of vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) are widely used given their impact on the scale, design, and extrapolation of different operational units. However, due to a number of factors, it is almost impossible to experimentally study each of the VLE systems. VLE simulations can be developed using representations that are strongly dependent on the nature and interactions of the compounds forming mixtures. A model that helps in predicting these interactions would facilitate simulation processes. A Gray Box Neural Network Model (GNM) was created as Binary Interaction Parameters predictors (BIP), which are estimated using state variables and information from pure components. This information was used to predict VLE behavior in mixtures and ranges not used in the mathematical formulation. The GNM prediction capabilities (including temperature dependency) showed an error level lower than 5% and 20% for mixtures considered and not considered in the training data, respectively. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The main objective of this study was to experimentally validate a mechanistic model for predicting the cooling efficiency (\u03b7) of wetted porous plates built with expanded clay. The expanded clay material was physically characterized by specific mass, surface area, and volume. The model was validated with dry bulb temperature (Tdb, \u00b0C) and air relative humidity (RH, %) data, which were continuously monitored in two different points, upstream and downstream the direction of the air passing through the porous plate. Data collection was carried out consecutively for a period of 10 days, between 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Average values for \u03b7, simulated and observed, were 74.8 \u00b1 7.4% and 68.3 \u00b1 8.3%, respectively. Based on the developed model, it was observed that \u03b7 was higher than 40% for Tdb &gt; 30 \u00b0C and constant RH at 45%. The simulation for predictions indicates that the increase in the air temperature greater than 20 \u00b0C may affect negatively the production in greenhouses from states located in tropical and subtropical countries as Minas Gerais, Brazil, if some design criteria in the evaporative cooling system are not revised. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Once hydrogels were obtained, they were characterized by Infrared Spectroscopy and Scanning Electronic Microscopy, and evaluated by mechanical and absorption tests as well as bactericide activity assays. The crosslinking degree between PVA/CH allowed obtaining a matrix with high absorption capacity and with gradual release of Aloe Vera, with mechanical properties and dimensional stability even after rehydration.

A major challenge when working with CNTs is the difficulty to distribute them evenly throughout liquids. This research is a comparative analysis of the dispersion of multi wall CNTs (MWCNTs) in different liquid media (distilled water, ultrapure water of type I [Milli-Q], ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] and cell culture medium [RPMI-1640]) by using two different sonication techniques (probe-type sonication and ultrasonic bath sonication) as well as determining the effect of sterilization in the presence and absence of fluid before dispersion. The results indicate that the best method to achieve a CNTs dispersion is to use a probe-type sonicator as well as to sterilize the CNTs samples in the presence of fluid. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Several ways to perform data encryption have been found, and one of the functions involved in standard algorithms such as RSA is the modular exponentiation. Basically, the RSA algorithm uses some properties of modular arithmetic to cipher and decipher plain text, with a certain performance dependence on text lengths. The growth in computing capacity has created the need to use robust systems that can perform calculations with significantly large numbers and the formulation of procedures focused on improving the speed to achieve it. One of these is the M-ary algorithm for the execution of the modular exponential function. This paper describes an implementation of this algorithm in reprogrammable hardware (FPGA) to evaluate its performance. The first section of this work introduces the M-ary algorithm. The second section uses block description for implementation understanding. The third section shows the results in time diagrams, and finally, the last section conclusions. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The article presents a proposal for a combination of laboratories in engineering, called hybrid laboratories (LH, for its acronym in Spanish), that is, a mixture of face-to-face (HO), virtual local (LV) and remote (LR) laboratories. To exemplify this proposal was developed a module for teaching processes in manufacturing (CNC machining). From this study we propose the generic characteristics of design, structure and the way of incorporation in a general system. The laboratory experiences are developed through a methodology supported by the tool 'Deployment of the Quality Function (QFD). The characteristics found in these LH laboratories are the basis for a possible general, replicable and scalable modular structure in a flexible laboratory practice development system. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this research work was to calibrate the Manning's roughness coefficient in rural non-instrumented basins using a distributed hydrological model. The process consisted of the selection of several basins with vegetal cover of forests and grasslands, and its subsequent experimental numerical study, in which the hydrological response hydrograph of each reference basin was obtained from the HEC-HMS software and the hydrograph to be calibrated was the Iber software, which is a hydrodynamic model based on the two-dimensional Saint Venant equations, solved by the finite volume method. Once the calibration process was carried out, the roughness coefficients with the best fit for each basin were identified with increases in precipitation, identifying the limitations of these values and the standard model used. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Natural rubber (NR) is a widely used biopolymer, but the variability of its properties is a great disadvantage. In this work, variation during a 6-month period of total solids (TSC), dry rubber (DRC), ash, volatile-matter, and nitrogen content of field natural rubber (NR) lattices and mechanical properties of NR solid sheets-based compounds was studied. NR samples were collected from IAN 710, IAN 873 and FX 3864 clones of Hevea brasiliensis at a plantation within the state of Antioquia, Colombia. Rainfall, environmental temperature, relative humidity, and sunlight hours were daily registered. NR sheets-based compounds were manufactured and their rheometric and mechanical properties were measured. Significant variations (p<0.05) among clones and tappings for most of the measured properties were found. Leaf senescence was the phenological stage that presented the greatest influence on NR properties. Some recommendations to control the variation of properties of raw NR during manufacturing of rubber goods were stated. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

After calibration and validation of the neural network, the results obtained show that it can be used to predict energy consumption with high accuracy. Once fully trained, the neural network is used for testing hypothetical operational scenarios aimed to reduce the energy consumption of a metro system.

The back analysis of dam failure and hydraulic model let us improve the spatial planning and the risk assessment. So the main core of this paper is to reconstruct the dam break and compute the spread flow generated, for this task we have been simulated the hydrograph and the peak flow. In this way, has been developed a HEC-RAS hydraulic model. The model shows that the dam failure was an almost instant (26 min), with a maximum flow of 13000 m3/s (maximum speed 30 m/s, and maximum draft 24 m). Finally, all the hydraulic results corroborate the great destruction generated and the catastrophic scenario observed in the historical images. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

It was shown from the measured results that hardness increases with the increase in all the studied parameters. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to determine the contributions of each parameter on the response variable. From the results, it was found that cutting speed has the most significant role in producing surface hardness (69.2%) followed by feed rate (24.4%), while the depth of cut has the lesser effect (6.4%). Finally, a simple equation is proposed, for the prediction of the values of surface hardness, which accounts for the effects of process parameters. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Thus, traffic congestion is high, generating long travel times for students, high operational costs, and mobility problems. This paper studies the impacts of a cooperative strategy between logistics operators using a mixed integer programming mathematical model, to find the optimal design of school routes on a network with the topology that describes the aforementioned road system. Two strategies are compared: a mixed loads strategy, where students from different schools share buses; and a single load strategy, where students from different schools cannot share buses. The objective is to minimize the total operational costs while satisfying the schools\u2019 time windows. Comparative results of the two models using exact and heuristic approaches are presented. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Gullies and drainage continue to be major issues in reclamation projects since soil erosion can be reactivated after the application of recovery measures. This paper describes a low-cost project framework for macrodrainage for a gully in Nazareno (MG, Brazil) to provide support to gully management and recovery. We used a simple methodology with the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and concentrated hydrologic and hydraulic models (freely available softwares). The basin has steep slopes (8 to 20%) and the water flows mainly to the northwest, which contribute to exacerbate erosion problems. We studied the effect of environmental conditions on different simulations to elaborate a drainage system project using the free software tools. Therefore, the findings of this paper can aid gully management and recovery for this and other areas with similar issues. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The coatings were developed using the powders feedstock having WC fine structured sizes, Cr3C2-NiCr 75-25 and NiCrWSiFeB, latter conventional grain sizes. The slurry erosion testing was performed using a laboratory made pot-type slurry erosion tester, at an impact velocity of 3.61m/s and 9.33 m/s and impact angle of 30 and 90\u00b0. The mechanism of material removal in slurry erosion was studied and discussed on microstructural investigations and mechanical properties under the erosion conditions. It was observed that the WC-CoCr cermet coating with fine WC grain exhibits higher erosion resistance as compared to conventional cermet coating due to its improved properties like low porosity, high micro-hardness and fracture toughness. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Different communication schemes for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) pretend to achieve a fair tradeoff between efficient energy consumption and the accomplishment of performance metrics. Among those schemes are the Cross-layer protocols that constitute a good choice to achieve the aforementioned tradeoff by introducing novel protocol techniques which are away from the traditional communications model. In this work we assessed the performance of a WBAN cross-layer protocol stack by comparing it against the performance of the protocols of the IEEE802.15.4 standard, which is commonly used for WBAN deployment nowadays. We evaluated the performance of both, cross-layer and IEEE802.15.4 approaches, by means of a simulation, by using a popular network simulator and its frameworks for wireless networks. And then performed a statistical comparison and ascertained that the cross-layer protocol stack offers better performance regarding a tradeoff between efficient energy consumption and performance metrics in our particular test scenario. We observed that, in general, the cross-layer approach outperformed both modes of IEEE802.15.4 standard (slotted and unslotted) regarding energy consumption, end to end delay, packet loss rate and goodput. The results of our experiments reported that the cross-layer strategy saves up to 80% more energy than IEEE802.15.4 unslotted and it is only a 5% below the slotted mode.

    "Abstract": "Fissures in concrete structures result from structural deterioration and inadequate building processes, among other factors. Traditional in siturepair is often expensive and complex. For this reason, self-healing techniques have been developed including the use of bacteria that precipitate calcium carbonate to seal fissures. However, adding bacteria directly to the concrete matrix reduces bacterial survival. We present a review of different methods of bacterial encapsulation and their effects on fissure repair and concrete resistance. We argue that encapsulation of Bacillussubtilis in clay is the most promising method, increasing concrete strength by 12% and repairing fissures of up to 0.52 mm. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Some retaining structures can be designed on a temporary basis, in accordance to the geotechnical design and a predefined construction plan. Off course this may not be valid elsewhere, but in Bras\u00edlia, where residual and laterized soils do prevail, best mechanical resistances are obtained in the porous clay setrata along the dry season. That means, it is controlled by soil\u2019s suction, i.e. soil behavior presents a dependency on the unsaturated response of the medium. In numerical terms, to predict the soil-structure behavior it is necessary to include the atmosphere-soil interaction in the computational tool, using a hypoplastic model. The paper thus details on this aspect and on the numerical simulations of an existing retaining structure founded in the tropical soil of Bras\u00edlia. The structure was monitored in terms of displacement, along local dry and wet seasons, and was simulated by a constitutive law calibrated by means of unsaturated laboratory tests. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Simulation of compression test of copper is made with the mortar contact method and assuming: axial symmetry, multiple point constraint of type plane, concentrate load and coulomb friction. Copper is simulated like isotropic material, elastic until it yields stress, and then like a hardening material with incremental plasticity. Copper behavior was calculated from experiments. Seventeen compression tests without lubrication were carried out to cylindrical samples at room temperature. The Stress vs. Strain relationship was calculated using two friction corrections; the Rowe Correction and the Dieter Correction. It was concluded that the simulation made with the mortar contact method and the Dieter Correction is a good alternative to simulate the compression test, being the differences between the simulation and the experiments lower than 7.33%, the hypothesis of axial symmetric does not keep away the simulation of the reality and new numerical analysis will allow the development of better friction corrections. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Silica with sizes &lt; 20 \u00b5m were functionalized with 5 wt% of magnetite nanoparticles. The efficiency of the adsorbents was evaluated through batch adsorption experiments of oil from oil in water emulsions at different pH, salinity and oil concentration using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. Results showed that for both the SiO2 support and the synthesized nano-intermediate, the adsorption equilibrium was reached in less tan 100 min. A comparison was made by employing a material typically used in the oil and gas industry. After the adsorption process, the materials can be recovered and regenerated trough thermal processes. It was observed that the magnetite nanoparticles over the support act as a catalyst for decomposition of the adsorbed oil. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Tailored materials formed by spontaneous two-dimensional arrangement of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane self-assembled monolayer on glass (amino-functionalized glass) has been exploited to attach biomolecules in well-organized structures useful in biosensing. Succinimidyl ester of both unpolymerized diacetylene liposome (NHS-DA-liposome) layer and PEGylated biotin (Bt-PEG-NHS) matrix were covalently bonded to the amino-functionalized glass by the NHS linker, and exposed to either Tyrosinase (Ty) or Streptavidin (SAV) solution. The interaction between Ty and polymerized NHS-PDA-liposome transformed the planarity of the PDA backbone, and a blue-to-red transition occurred; Bt-PEG attached to the fluorescent-SAV by bioaffinity. Sensing capability of bioplatform systems was evaluated by Uv-vis spectroscopy or fluorescence microscopy. Biomolecule functionalized SAMs retained the recognition potential of colorimetric Ty-PDA-liposome after biological interaction, and also facilitated the fabrication of a protein-resistant matrix with a particular affinity property. This surface chemistry is accessible to depositing proteins on both SAM-coated glass surface, and tethered to SAM, resulting in optical bioplatform arrays. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The incorporation of wind generation in microgrids is growing progressively. This integration can introduce problems in the dynamics and power quality of the electrical system due to the wind fluctuations. This work proposes a controller composed by a power conditioning system (PCS), a Flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS) and a Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) to palliate problems introduced by wind generation in microgrids. A model of the PCS/FESS-VRFB controller is presented and a method to control the power exchanged between the controller and the power system is suggested. The control method has two modes, namely: power levelling and frequency control. The performance of the PCS/FESS-VRFB controller is studied when it works with wind power generation in the microgrid through simulation tests. Results demonstrate suitable performance of the control methods and high effectiveness to level the wind power fluctuations and to provide support to the frequency control of the microgrid. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The experiments were based on the comparison between the results obtained from the current classification methods and those derived from the SVM.

In the cavities between the wood elements and the panels, a thermal and acoustic insulator must be added. Unfortunately, almost all of the currently used insulators (mineral wool, expanded polystyrene, polyurethane) are not biodegradable and require the use of vapor barriers (polyethylene sheets, aluminum foils, etc.) that deteriorate rapidly and that are relatively environmentally unfriendly. In this article, the use of coconut fiber instead of conventional insulators is suggested. The acoustic absorption and thermal conductivity coefficients of composite sections taken from wood walls with coconut fiber are estimated. In this way, good thermo-acoustic conditions inside the wood building are achieved using an ecological insulating material. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The empirical results obtained from a final sample of 1,836 surveys emphasize the importance of performance expectations for both groups. Social Influence is another determinant of electronic purchase as well. In addition, an exploratory study of the moderating effect of the educational level and socioeconomic status for each group was performed, finding strong evidence of the influence of these demographic variables, which suggests that, as a conclusion that makes a great contribution to this country, access to electronic shopping is strongly related to educational level and socioeconomic status. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Green supplier selection aims to choose the best supplier, among several alternatives, taking into account not only traditional criteria such as cost and quality of service or product, but also considering the ability to produce these products or services fulfilling environmental standards or regulations and with the least negative impact on the environment. In real green selection contexts, sometimes a single static evaluation of suppliers is not enough for a conclusive decision and it is necessary to analyze suppliers\u2019 evolution throughout different moments. Obviously, some parameters are not constant over time, rather they are dynamic and change from one period to another. Consequently, decisions about suppliers take place in a dynamic environment, where the final decision is made after an exploratory process. Besides, the available information is vague or imprecise that does not involve probabilistic uncertainty. In such situations, the use of 2-tuple linguistic model provides a convenient way to represent linguistic assessments through linguistic variables and to model uncertainty. In this paper, the main focus is on finding the right supplier by using a multi-criteria multi-period decision making approach based on the 2-tuple linguistic computational model. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The modernization of productive areas -industrial estates, technology and logistics parks, etc.-, involves the need to incorporate solutions that provide them with greater sustainability. The specificities of these areas, such as their high energy consumption or significant water intake, means that their implementation requires the adoption of measures that reduce the impact on the environment, contributing to the concept of a sustainable productive area. The implementation of renewable energies and Smart Grids, the improved water cycle and the introduction of urbotics are solutions that enable making these spaces more sustainable in the field of infrastructures. This article analyses and verifies their implementation in a significantly important industrial area of Spain, ultimately concluding that such elements are scarcely implemented in productive areas. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper describes a methodology based on the Rosenblueth point estimate method to analyze the active earth pressure developed on retaining walls for c-\u03c6 soil backfill under seismic loading conditions. The fundamentals of this methodology are to use two point estimates to examine a variable in the safety analysis: the mean value and the standard deviation. When the horizontal seismic acceleration coefficient increases, the overturning factor of safety decreases, whereas the probability of failure increases, particularly for coefficients greater than 0.2. In addition, the mean factor of safety increases when the vertical seismic acceleration coefficient increases, but the probability of failure remains practically identical for the considered critical factor of safety (1.15). \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The stresses in the hip area have great importance because of their relationship to the health of the joint. Finite element models can predict contact between cartilages, however, contact patterns in unilateral transfemoral amputees have not yet been found in literature. We thus want to present an initial approach in the contact mechanics of the hip joint of these amputees. From an existing database, three transfemoral amputees who use prostheses were chosen. Their respective hips and femur were obtained from tomography, and so as their cartilages from their respective articular surfaces. Finite element models were created per patient and static bipedestation was analyzed. At the beginning of contact between cartilages, contact stresses were determined. The results showed that the stresses of the amputated side were higher than that of the non-amputated, in terms of average and peak contact stress. These were located in the anterior and superior zones, respectively. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Conclusions point out that several of the models recently formulated need to be validated with real data and large-scale systems tests. Moreover, demand-site management and micro grids are aspects that lack of the development of complete optimal power flow models.

    "Abstract": "The dominant model of atmospheric circulation is based on the notion that hot air rises, creating horizontal winds. A second major driver has been proposed [1] in the biotic pump theory (BPT), by which intense condensation is the prime cause of surface winds from ocean to land. Critics of the BPT argue that air movement resulting from condensation is isotropic [2]. This paper explores the physics of water condensation under mild atmospheric conditions, within a purpose-designed square-section 4.8m-tall closed-system structure. The data show a highly significant correlation (R2 &gt;0.96, p value &lt;0.001) between observed airflows and partial pressure changes from condensation. The assumption that condensation of water vapour is always isotropic is therefore incorrect. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Image fusion is the generation of an image f that combines the most relevant information from a set of images of the same scene, acquired with different cameras or camera settings. Multi-Focus Image Fusion (MFIF) aims to generate an image fe with extended depth-of-field from a set of images taken at different focal distances or focal planes, and it proposes a solution to the typical limited depth-of-field problem in an optical system configuration. A broad variety of works presented in the literature address this problem. The primary approaches found there are domain transformations and block-of-pixels analysis. In this work, we evaluate different systems of supervised machine learning applied to MFIF, including k-nearest neighbors, linear discriminant analysis, neural networks, and support vector machines. We started from two images at different focal distances and divided them into rectangular regions. The main objective of the machine-learning-based classification system is to choose the parts of both images that must be in the fused image in order to obtain a completely focused image. For focus quantification, we used the most popular metrics proposed in the literature, such as: Laplacian energy, sum-modified Laplacian, and gradient energy, among others. The evaluation of the proposed method considered classifier testing and fusion quality metrics commonly used in research, such as visual information fidelity and mutual information feature. Our results strongly suggest that the automatic classification concept satisfactorily addresses the MFIF problem. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to verify the SCBA\u2019s potential use as a partial replacement of Portland cement. Therefore, the experiment was divided in two stages; in the first, mineralogical and chemical analyses were performed with two samples of ash, in-natura and calcined at a temperature of 600\u00b0C for 6h. After these analyzes, it was observed that the calcined ash presented a greater tendency of material in the amorphous state, which possibly made the material the most reactive. For this reason, only the calcined ash was ground for 1 and 2h. These samples were further studied in order to check the pozzolanic activity index and the compressive strength, evaluating the replacement of 10, 20 and 30% Portland cement by ground SCBA. The results showed an increase in the pozzolanic activity index only in samples of calcined and ground SCBA, showing that calcined ash must undergo a grinding process to present pozzolanic activity. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

One of this system is the structural Light Steel Framing (LSF), which consists in cold formed steel frames juxtaposed with drywall enclosure of different materials, such as cement boards, wood boards and plasterboards. Despite of the advantages of this system, there is still a concern about their fire safety. Therefore, this paper aimed to verify the fire resistance of LSF systems with two types of plasterboard, one composed of standard plasterboard (common) and the other one by fire-resistant plasterboards. The samples were tested according to the [1]. It was evaluated integrity, thermal insulation and structural stability of each solution. The results presented the system with fire-resistant plasterboards more secure when compared to the standard plasterboard (common). In both cases, the sample\u2019s failure occurred due to the loss of integrity in the panels\u2019 joints. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The underfloor plates were molded with thickness of 3, 5 and 7 centimeters, and 3cm plus 1cm of conventional coating. Slabs were submitted to specific mass and standardized impact sound pressure level tests. Results showed a correlation between specific masses and impact sound values, being that 7cm thickness slabs with smaller specific mass, with total aggregate replacement, presented noise intensity reductions of 17dB in comparison to same thickness slabs with natural sand and smaller content of EVA coarse aggregate; and a 28dB reduction in relation to the slab without underfloor. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The implemented optical network does not use expensive optical devices such as doped fibers to amplify, dispersion compensating fibers or correction errors algorithms. The received QR code contains different kind of distortions generated by the conventional fiber optic network. The transmitted results are analyzed using the bit error rate and signal noise ratio parameters.

According to several tests, our Overall Accuracy (OA) is 0.97 with agreement (\u03baappa index, \u03ba) of 0.75. Additionally, unlike typical systems in which a low false acceptance (FP) implies high false rejection (FN), our system can work simultaneously with FN and FP equal to zero (i.e. OA=1; \u03ba=1). Finally, our system works with blind identification, it means, without preliminary knowledge of the audio recordings or a training step; an imperative characteristic for audio forensics. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this article, a method to infer the parameters of a conic given a set of rectangular coordinates that belong to the geometric entity is shown. The methodology consists of solving a Tikhonov regulation problem where the unregulated term introduces the non-linear nature of the conical body and the regulated the restriction associated to the discriminant of the quadratic equation, then the solution is computed minimizing the resulting cost function where the Regularization parameter is tuned using the L-Curve technique. The model was validated with synthetic and real data from digital images, as well as subject to comparison against other state of the art alternatives. The results show that the method is robust against atypical values and the phenomenon of occlusion present in the data. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Network on Chip (NoC) systems were originally developed to provide high performance, using the availability of several processing units, connected to a wired network inside the integrated circuit. Wireless NoC (WiNoC or WNoC) are a natural evolution of NoC systems, which integrate a hierarchical communication inside the chip for the sake of improving scalability. Task mapping in WNoC systems represents a challenging process, which often involves several optimization objectives, such as power, performance, throughput, resources usage, and network metrics. This paper describes a genetic algorithm based approach for finding optimal tasks-mapping solutions in design time, for embedded systems working over a WiNoC. The optimization objectives were: Speedup, Energy Consumption, and Bandwidth. The target network used for simulation may be viewed as a two-level hierarchical WiNoC. The first level corresponds to a set of subnets which are linked by wires and mesh-type. The second level corresponds to a star-topology of wireless links, which connect the first level subnets. Proposed algorithm exhibits a good performance in relation to the optimization objectives, concerning the target heterogeneous WiNoC. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents the analysis and implementation of two control laws applied on a case study. The first one and main focus of this work is the Embedded Model Control whose main characteristics are the active disturbance rejection and uncertainties handling. Here diverse control parameters are tested such that performance limits are exposed due to model limitations. On the other hand there is a classic PID control law, based on operations on the trajectory error as a control paradigm that not requires an explicit model for its physical implementation. The implementation and tests are made on a commercial didactic process, where performance and disturbance rejection properties are verified, showing that even with this simple process the performance may be gracefully degraded as a consequence of the absence of the system model embedded in the control law. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Field measurements and spatially explicit models were used to model surface hydrology and piezometric levels. Satellite data were used to derive inundated areas and vegetation. Existing maps from the national geographic institute (IGAC) were used to define the spatial distribution of hydromorphic soils. Special attention was paid to agricultural infrastructure, levees and diversion channels used to modify surface hydrology in order to promote plantations and cattle grazing. A total of 536 km2 meet one or more wetland conditions according to biophysical variables, but only 393 km2 were selected, using logical rules, as wetland pixels. The combination of biophysical variables to define wetland potential is discussed in terms of the spatial distribution and the implications for environmental resource management. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This process is typically characterized as a continuous process, which may become a barrier for the randomization of the applied data treatments. This article aims at optimizing the factors that influence the processing of cocoa cultivars during solidification of liquor. Based on this, it was proposed, as a design of experiment (DOE), a three level factorial plan (23) with three repeated measurements. Treatments were organized in random blocks with divided-cells (split-plot). The experiment presents the best combinations between the factors \u2018pump flow\u2019 and \u2018conveyor speed\u2019 for each kind of cocoa liquor.

ANN Training was carried out online using the back-propagation algorithm, part of the R software. The predictive capacity was evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Also, a network that showed the best predictive capacity for the deforestation surface was generated for the baseline scenario and the simulated scenario incorporating the new roads.

Subsequently, kappa carrageenan biofilms mixed with AgNPs were prepared.

    "Abstract": "This paper presents how to get the phase of the electrical impedance from the analysis of transient signals, using Fourier Transform and Wavelet Transform. Traditionally, Fourier Transform has been used for these analysis, however, Fourier Transform is mainly oriented to the analysis of periodic signals and not to the analysis of transient signals. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method based in the Wavelet Transform, which uses as wavelet mother, the Morlet modified that is an adaptation of the traditional complex Morlet, to obtain a better representation of the phase in the frequency domain. Such improvement is valid taking as reference the results obtained by the software \u201cMATLAB\u201d from the impedance of an RLC circuit in response to the impulse of the voltage signal, managing to improve the limitations of the Fourier Transform for the analysis of this type of signals. The study has been divided into two parts, the first part includes what has been done theoretically and through simulation, the second part is to present the experimental results of a real case validating the method developed. For both cases the same two mathematical methods were used, where the potential of the Wavelet Transform for the analysis of transient shown in the obtaining of the electrical impedance front Fourier Transform. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The proposed study system describes the device transmission process as a function of the input angle variation (d\u03b1), the height of the user\u2019s feet (HF) and the pulley curvature function (C), resulting from the variation of its radius (dR) over time (dt). In order to explore and compare the different behaviours and identify possible solutions four different configurations of curvatures were proposed. Causal diagrams and differential equations describe the simulation scenario. The resulting application model supports the use of a systemic frame and methods as a pre-response to the validation of design proposals. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Cyanide is considered a highly toxic species for any ecosystem in as much as it causes disease in humans, contributes to the loss of soil fertility and contaminates water sources, constituting an important factor in the mortality of aquatic flora and fauna. The aim of this work is to evaluate the potential ability of the natural sponge Luffa Cylindrica as an adsorbent material to remove cyanide from aqueous medium. In order to measure the adsorption capacity the experiments were carried out through the application of a factorial experimental design that includes variables such as pH and contact time. Suitable conditions to retain the cyanide ion were pH 9.0 and a contact time of 10 minutes. The adsorption behavior is represented by the Freundlich isotherm, and the adsorption kinetics fits the pseudo-second order kinetic model.

Polymers are versatile materials, they can be obtained in several chemical configurations and mixtures to generate composite materials with synergistic properties. In this research, a scientific and technological analysis of the biomedical application of polymeric biomaterials was performed, along with the compilation of their applications, production, mechanical properties and important features for the biomedical industry. Polymeric biomaterials are a cutting-edge topic, as reflected in the number of scientific articles and patents. Nowadays, these biomaterials can replace, reinforce or fulfil a specific function in the human body.

    "Abstract": "A reliable electric power supply is of ever increasing importance in the Colombian electricity market. As such, the Energy and Gas Regulation Commission, (CREG for its acronym in Spanish), has contracted technical studies to be undertaken in order to assess reliability for Colombian electric utilities. This paper focuses on a new methodology to diagnose the reliability of a single distribution circuit that is to be used in Colombian electric utilities. The proposed methodology includes calculating known reliability indexes (SAIFI, SAIDI, CAIDI, etc.) as well as new reliability indexes in order to determine the incidence of causes of failure. This paper explains some of the required files\u2019 characteristics (input and output files) in order to execute two applications associated with the previously mentioned methodology. These two applications were developed using Microsoft Excel for the Strategic Energy Business Unit at EMCALI EICE ESP, located on Santiago de Cali, Valle del Cauca, Colombia, South America. This article describes some features of these applications. The first case study presented, about the first application, is calculated based on this methodology, and results obtained are compared with those obtained using ETAP software. Finally, the second case study, regarding the second application, is calculated based on this methodology and results obtained are shown in this document. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "A fundamental part of the probabilistic forecasting of wind energy process is to take into account wind speed forecasts. To achieve accurate probabilistic forecast of wind output, we developed a hybrid methodology using a nonparametric technique known as SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis) and (CKDE) Conditional Kernel Density Estimation. SSA is employed to forecast wind speed and CKDE to obtain probabilistic forecasts of wind energy, based on the fact that wind power generation has a nonlinear relation with the wind speed and both are random variables distributed according to a joint density function. An hourly wind dataset including wind speed and wind power is used to illustrate the approach. Once the wind speed forecasts are obtained the corresponding probabilistic forecast of the wind power generation is estimated for a lead time of 24 hours ahead. The results obtained are compared with other existing methodologies. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Protopectinase SE (PPase-SE) is a polygalacturonase produced by Geotrichum klebahnii with the capacity to liberate pectin through protopectin hydrolysis. The protopectin cleavage is a typical heterogeneous-catalysis reaction whose interaction between the enzyme and the protopectin substrate from lemon albedo along with the release of the pectin-reaction product were the objectives of this investigation. The interaction between PPase-SE and protopectin depended on the particle size and the structure of the substrate as well as on the nature of the buffer. The adsorption kinetics follows, for small particles, a Langmuir isotherm pattern. The reaction exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics, giving respective apparent-Km and Vmax values of 30.2 g/l and 57.3 g/l.h. The better results in enzyme adsorption and pectin releasing were obtained with citrate and citrate-phosphate buffers. This report constitutes the first investigation in pectin solubilization involving a model for the substrate-binding mechanism within the pectinase-protopectinase system. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The functional meaning of these signatures is still unclear, the existence of cellular mechanisms to identify the source of individual signals and contextualize incoming messages can be a powerful information processing strategy for the nervous system. We recently built different models to study the ability of a neural network to encode and process information based on the emission and recognition of specific signature with homogeneous populations where the neurons in the network will be able to recognize and emit the same firms with the same probability. In this paper, we further analyze the features that can influence on the information processing ability when we vary the probability of recognition that each neuron has for different signatures in networks heterogeneous.

Samples were produced by the solid-state reaction recipe. X-ray diffraction experiments show that the material crystallizes in a monoclinic structure, P21/n space group. SEM images exhibit a granular submicrometric surface. Temperature curves of magnetic susceptibility reveal a paramagnetic response. Curie law fitting permitted to obtain a magnetic moment 10.28 \u00b5B. Polarization as a function of electric fields shows a hysteretic feature with 264.28 relative dielectric constant at 300 K. DFT calculations of electronic structure suggest the semiconductor character of this material, energy gap 3.21 eV for the spin-up polarization and 0.26 eV for spin-down. The calculated effective magnetic moment was 10.0 \u00b5B, which is strongly in accordance with the measured value.

From there, fibre bundles were extracted randomly, and a part of the fibre bundles was treated with NaOH (mercerization). Later, tensile tests with different calibration lengths were made for calculate the elastic modulus and the tensile strength of the treated and untreated fibre bundles.

    "Abstract": "The synthesis and use of materials as hydrotalcites have a high impact on development of new materials and technological advances, applied in areas such as catalysis and environmental chemistry. An aspect of vital importance is the temperature of collapse of the HTLc structure, because from this fact depend the properties of solids obtained. In this work was studied the thermal behavior of nickel-aluminum hydrotalcite, and determined the Ea associated with the collapse and formation of NiO. It was observed that the greater interaction among carbonate ions and OH groups occurs at 250 \u00b0C, temperature at which the collapse of the HTLc structure occurs. The solid N0,75A0,25 requires less energy to collapse, which is due to the greater distances between the positive sheets. The solid N0,66A0,33 need more energy for the formation of NiO, which is due to higher content of Al3+, disfavoring the growth of the initial particles of NiO. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The eclogites underwent a clockwise PT trajectory with a post-Ppeak(at 10.5 kbar and 535\u00b0C) slight increase of temperature to a maximum (Tpeak) about 8.5 kbar and 575\u00b0C and a subsequent cooling during decompression to about 4.5 kbar and 530\u00b0C. Geochemical data indicate protoliths that correspond to basalts from normal type mid-ocean ridges (NMORB). All these features suggest that ophiolite remnants are involved in the subduction and final architecture of the Arqu\u00eda Complex. The progressive convergence led to the formation of the eclogite facies assemblages at the maximum depth in the continental crust. The eclogites reported in this study represent an excellent example of high-pressure metamorphic rocks in orogenic belts, very useful to understanding plate subduction and continent collision processes. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "During the braking process, the heat produced by the friction between the brake pads and the disc is not quickly dissipated, this depends on the geometry and material of manufacture. Therefore, in the disc brake when a strong braking is caused, they can accumulate large amounts of heat in a short time, producing high temperature gradients. Under these conditions, functionality and safety of the brake system may be compromised. The objective of this research is to simulate the behavior of the temperature between the disk surface and the ventilation channels in three brakes ventilated disc, in order to compare the results obtained mathematically with those obtained in the Finite Element Analysis (F.E.A) with help Solidworks Simulation Software. The results show that the disks can be used effectively in extreme work conditions, while ensuring high levels of security.

    "Abstract": "Modified control charts are used to monitor and control manufacturing processes which are considered to be six-sigma processes. The use of these charts is based on the idea that the cost of identifying and correcting special causes is much higher than the cost of off-target products. Therefore, the process mean is essentially acceptable as long as it is anywhere within the specification limits. These concepts are applied to the packaging process in multihead weighers. The weight of the packed product, seen as the quality characteristic to be monitored, must be as close to a specified target weight as possible and comply with applicable regulations. The packaging process was previously optimized and improved using a packaging strategy, which was evaluated through a proposed packing algorithm. In this way, a set of numerical experiments were conducted to examine the solutions generated, which were subsequently monitored. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Sodium nitrate is an essential food additive widely used in cured meats. The increased unfavorable perceptions about chemicals in foods and their repercussions on health have positioned nitrites as undesirable compounds in meat products. Natural and organic ingredients have taken an important place within the consumer preferences. Here, obtaining nitrite from natural sources was achieved using nitrate-reducing bacteria Staphylococcus carnosus and S. xylosus. Pre-incubation strains into a celery-based medium allowed the stimulation of nitrate reductase activity. The increased values of substrate, the oxygen condition and pH influenced the nitrite generation significantly (p&lt;0.05). The reduction rate from nitrate to nitrite was 50.85%, with a value of 320.2 mg L-1 of nitrite. This method presents characteristics comparable to those traditionally applied in the generation of conventional sodium nitrite leading the food industry to take advantage of fermentation processes to supply needs in meats and supplementary food products. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Recent advances in polymer technology have led to binders that can be used to produce interlayer mixtures with good mechanical properties. In this study, two polymer-modified asphalt binders were evaluated, both from the production of strain relief asphalt mixtures used as interlayers in the field. The binder characterization was presented in two groups: (i) the empirical tests required in the Brazilian specification, and (ii) the rheological properties (frequency/temperature sweep and MSCR tests). Results showed that the difference in rheological properties of the asphalt binder used for strain relief asphalt mixtures did not follow the same difference obtained according to the empirical tests of the Brazilian specification. The G*/sin\u03b4 and MSCR parameters (Jnr and percentage of recovery) were able to differentiate the asphalt binders, but the MSCR parameters were more sensitive. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The hybrid paradigm (often referred to as Cyber-Physical-Systems) can be employed to understand (by modelling) or to manipulate (by control design) the dynamical behavior of systems. In this paper, a system of wide use in applications (Buck-type power converter) with a simple type of controller (On-Off) is addressed from a perspective of hybrid modelling, developed upon a set-based formulation scheme. This approach is novel in the sense that it allows the formulation of generic formal rules as sets for the transition between continuous and discrete modes of a hybrid model, which can be further implemented as software routines for simulation purposes.

    "Abstract": "This paper proposes a radar-based sensing system that estimates the coordinates for shorelines based on image-processing techniques. The proposed system provides shore estimations without appreciable loss of resolution and avoids the costs associated with bathymetries and/or satellite images. The system is comprised of a commercial radar, a GPS, and a heading sensor, which communicates to a central node that georeferences the radar measurements and runs the image-processing algorithms. A dedicated FPGA-based unit is implemented to interface with the radar internal signaling to extract and deliver the radar information. In the central node, a novel mathematical model is proposed for georefencing radar measurements to WSG-84 coordinates. A seam-carving-like algorithm is applied over the estimated coordinates to create a shoreline based on a probability heat map. The system performance is validated using official geographical information, showing that a continuous shoreline can be generated with a CEP of up to 6 m without incurring elevated costs. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The study of pile foundation reliability and safety is based on the analysis of the probabilistic moments, average and coefficient of variation that are associated with the resistant surface. This surface imposes the condition that there is a finite population represented by the isolated elements of the foundation. This work presents an analysis of a statistical adjustment of the sample when estimating the population\u2019s parameters and using the order statistic concepts. The resistance values and the analyzed foundations that were solicited were based on data published in the technical literature in which the resistance variable was measured from load tests. The number of tests in situ concludes, specifically that, for the diversity of the analyzed foundations, the order statistic can be a sufficiently useful tool to estimate the failure probability of pile foundations in cases in which the number of load tests are smaller. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

To do so, a total of twelve conceptual designs obtained in a design experiment were measured and compared. In this experiment, four teams of three designers solved different design problems, applying brainstorming, SCAMPER and functional analysis as design methods. The quality of the design solutions have been evaluated in terms of feasibility and effectiveness by experts through a questionnaire. Feasibility and effectiveness were then compared with the novelty, usefulness and creativity, the results showing that as novelty increases, feasibility tends to be lower, and the more usefulness the design offers, the more effective it is. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

In this manner, seven solvents were used to fucoxanthin extraction, highlighting methanol and ethanol with 6.282 and 4.187 mg/g, respectively. However, petroleum ether and n-hexane were the worst solvents for fucoxanthin extraction, obtaining approximately 12-folds less content. Extraction time was another relevant parameter in improve fucoxanthin extraction where 10 min was the best time reaching 7.464 mg/g under 100% ethanol.

Varying mixtures of RPET/Cloisite 10A were prepared in a single screw extruder. The mixtures obtained were reprocessed in capillary rheometer-type single screw extruder and passed through a capillary die, at high shear stress to increase the dispersion of clay in the polymer matrix. Results show physical degradation of materials. X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated exfoliation of clay with low concentrations. Furthermore, rheology results show that viscosity rate decreases with increase in clay concentration in the mixtures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals low dispersion of clay with an increase of concentration. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Magnesium and its alloys are used for biomaterials in orthopedic applications. Such alloys are still under development, and they are used due to their biocompatibility and mechanical (bone-like) properties that make them suitable to be used as biomaterials. Magnesium has potential to be used in biodegradable implants because of its capacity to support tissue regeneration processes. Therefore, multiple strategies have been developed to enhance magnesium properties. Coatings on magnesium alloys have been used to improve the cytocompatibility and corrosion resistance of magnesium. Particularly, titanium dioxide can be used as coating on magnesium to help regulating degradation rate and overcome some issues when magnesium is inserted into the human body. Accordingly, this paper is a critical review to consolidate the available literature about titanium dioxide coatings on magnesium alloys for potential use as biomaterials.

We propose a comparison of granular approaches of Simulated Annealing (GSA), of Variable Neighborhood Search (GVNS) and of a probabilistic Tabu Search (pGTS) for the LRPH. Thus, the proposed approaches consider a subset of the search space in which non-favorable movements are discarded regarding a granularity factor. The proposed algorithms are experimentally compared for the solution of the LRPH, by taking into account the CPU time and the quality of the solutions obtained on the instances adapted from the literature.

Each technique was simulated with HYSYS v3.2 process simulator. In order to compare, the same ethanol molar flow was established for ethanol-water mixture (216.5 kmol/h). Ethanol molar composition was higher than 99.7% for all technologies. Slightly lower composition was obtained for the extractive distillation. The influence of operating parameters on the efficiency of simulated technologies was determined by analyzing three case studies. Temperature, molar flows of liquid and vapor and composition profiles through the columns were analyzed for each process. According to economic evaluation techniques, all the alternatives are economically advantageous because of net profits. The greatest benefits are obtained for adsorption with molecular sieves because of its highest relative net present value. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Consequences of natural disasters in recent years have shown the complexity of these situations. In disaster situations, the location of relief centers, the distribution of supplies and the fleet sizing are some of the most important decisions. In most cases the execution of this operations lead to contradictory objectives, mainly, logistic costs and unmet demand costs. On the one hand, minimize unmet demand implies higher logistics costs. On the other hand, minimize logistics costs without considering the unmet demand may lead with an inefficient attendance in the affected areas. In this paper, we propose a bi-objective stochastic programing model for the integrated problem of location-distribution and fleet sizing. We solve instances based on the mega disaster in the Mountain Region of Rio de Janeiro in 2011. We compare the solutions of a bi-objective model in respect to solutions of a mono-objective version, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each model. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper proposes an integrated method for estimating the manufacturing competitiveness of companies using their comparative performance in their manufacturing objectives. The developed method uses an extensive analysis of the literature along with expert analysis through the Delphi method to identify the factors influencing competitiveness in the industry under study. Different statistical coefficients such as Cronbach\u2019s alpha, Kendall\u2019s W, Fleiss\u2019 kappa and Intraclass Correlation are used to assure reliability in the instruments and the experts\u2019 opinion. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a subsequent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) are used as the means to obtain the measurement model with which to calculate an indicator of manufacturing competitiveness. An empirical case study using the proposed method is performed in a sample of apparel maquiladora plants. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "An analysis of the rainfall conditions and the influence of the infiltration processes on the slope stability are essential in tropical mountain terrains due to the extensive occurrence of rainfall-induced landslides. Distributed physical-based models can be coupled with techniques that relate the factor of safety to rainfall thresholds associated with the occurrence of this phenomenon. This study presents a methodology that determines the thresholds of rainfall intensity and duration, for the prediction of shallow landslides, using a distributed physical model called TRIGRS. In the analysis, it is used a percentage of the critical area of failure defined for a study area. The conditions of mean intensity and duration of rain that induce this failing area to be reached are adjusted to a potential equation, within specific ranges of duration and intensity. The model is used in a sub-basin of the Valle de Aburr\u00e1 (Colombia), and the results are compared with rainfall thresholds defined with another distributed physical model. The obtained results reaffirm that the conditions of rainfall intensity and duration that trigger landslides in a region exhibit scaling properties determined by relationships of potential equations, like those obtained by other researchers in different places of the world. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This work presents the microstructural evolution of mechanically alloyed Mg2Ni0.5Co0.5and a study of its hydriding properties. Mg, Ni, and Co elemental powders (atomic ratios of 2:0.5:0.5, respectively) were mechanically alloyed in a Spex 8000D high-energy mill for 36 h (amorphous sample) and subsequently submitted to a thermal treatment at 673 K for 15 min (nanocrystalline sample). The characterizations of the samples were performed with X-ray diffraction. A Sievert-type volumetric hydriding process was done at 363 K and with hydrogen pressure of 2 MPa. Desorption process was evaluated through differential scanning calorimetry. Based on the obtained results, it is possible to conclude that the amorphous structure absorbs more hydrogen, reaching a maximum of 3.6 wt. % H. Desorption process events depend on amorphous or nanocrystalline states. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

To achieve accurate measurements of temperatures, an optical fiber sensor was developed and calibrated for real-time and in situ measurements of the extract. Using a central composite design, the effects of the processing time, power levels and sample volume were evaluated together with the concentration of the soluble solids of the liquid coffee extract and the position of the sample in the microwave cavity. In addition, the physicochemical and sensory properties of the product were evaluated. The results indicate that the greatest reduction of the microorganism occurred when the processing time was 19 seconds at a power level of 6 using a sample volume of 11 mL and that the highest biological destruction occurs when the sample is placed in the center of the microwave cavity. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The simulation model employs basic design hypotheses according to NTC-04 [1] and ACI 318-11 [2] for rectangular concrete beams subjected to bending with rebars in the tension zone only. Concrete compression strength is included in the model as a random variable to estimate the uncertainty in bending strength on rectangular beams. Concrete compressive strength is evaluated for more than 16,000 compression tests for mixtures designed for 200 kgf/cm2(19.6 MPa) and 250 kgf/cm2(24.5 MPa).

    "Abstract": "This study focuses on the relative importance of the forcing agents of Atrato River plume as it propagates in a tropical estuary located in the Gulf of Uraba in the Colombian Caribbean Sea. Six campaigns of intensive field data collection were carried out from 2004 to 2007 to identify the main features of the plume and to calibrate and validate a numerical model. Field data and numerical models revealed high spatial and temporal plume variability according to the magnitudes of river discharges, tidal cycles, and wind stress. Atrato River discharge spreads over a considerable portion of the gulf, but only occupies the top 2 m of the surface layer. The tide modifies the position of the plume by inducing a horizontal migration of the salinity front during the day. Two principal modes of circulation in the gulf were identified under different wind conditions. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Hyperspectral remote sensors acquire data coming from hundreds of narrow bands through the electromagnetic spectrum; this allows the terrestrial and maritime surfaces to be characterized for Earth observation. Hyperspectral image processing requires algorithms that combine spatial and spectral information. One way to take full advantage of spatial-spectral data within hyperspectral imagery is to use multiscale representations. A multiscale representation generates a family of images were fine details are systematically removed. This paper compares two multiscale representation approaches in order to improve the classification of hyperspectral imagery. The first approach is based on nonlinear diffusion, which obtains a multiscale representation by successive filtering. The second is based on binary partition tree, an approach inspired in region growing. The comparison is performed using a real hyperspectral image and a supper vector machine classifier. Both representation approaches allowed the classification of hyperspectral imagery to be improved. However, nonlinear diffusion results surpassed those obtained using binary partition tree. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Work has been done reporting papermaking fibers from six species of agaves: A. lechuguilla, A. angustifolia, A. tequilana, A. American., A. mapisaga and A. salmiana using different methods for extraction fiber. Their results indicate that A. mapisaga and A. salmiana were the species that showed better characteristics for the possible development of paper. In this paper we sought to create a new value added to the waste leaves Agav\u00e1ceas agribusiness processing of pulque, from A. salmiana B. Otto ex Salm. Pulp was obtained by two methods: alkaline pulping method known as Organosolv. Characteristics and efficiencies of the processes under an optimization study were evaluated. As a result, it is concluded that optimal and reproducible for cellulose pulp by alkaline pulping A.salmiana conditions were: [NaOH] 12%; 24 hours; [Na2CO3] 2.5% and [Na2SO4] 0.2%. In contrast to the acid pulping optimum conditions they were: 60% H2O; 6 hours; [CH3COOH] and 80% [HCl] 0.5%. On the basis of response analysis \"more better performance\" in the ANOVA, we found that for the alkaline pulping, the factor having the greatest impact on the process is time, and the factor that has lower incidence [Na2CO3]; on the other hand, for acid pulping the factor having the greatest contribution it is [CH3COOH] and the lowest incidence is the stirring rate. In the alkaline pulping confirmatory experiments yield 39.69% cellulose pulp A.salmianawas obtained whereas for organosolv pulping yield 71.57% was obtained. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

There are few practical methodologies to assess a Transformer Risk Index (TRI). In addition, such proposals do not consider the latest advances in techniques for transformer health valuation, and they also have other drawbacks. This paper proposes a practical method to undertake risk analysis of power transformer fleets, which deal with the stated problem. The proposal appropriately considers the best attributes of the methods reported in literature in order to compute the two components of TRI, i.e., the failure probability factor and the consequence factor. Moreover, this paper contributes to the risk analysis issue by including risk matrices and clustering techniques to support the decision-making process. The presented method was tested on a fleet of fourteen transformers.

    "Abstract": "A practical problem in automation systems modeling is the choice between a fully hybrid approach and the fluidization of some parts conserving the general discrete event approach. This paper explores the approach based on specific hybrid parts into a discrete event system using a unified Petri nets environment called GHENeSys (General Hierarchical Enhanced Net System), which follows the ISO/IEC 15909 standard and includes extensions such as hierarchy and time concepts. Then, a design method based on GHENeSys Timed Hybrid Petri Net (GTHPN) technique is proposed to model these hybrid parts. GHENeSys subnets are associated with macro-places and help to control combinatorial explosion and has extended arcs to guarantee the GTHPN applicability to practical cases. All resulting models of the approach proposed could also benefit from an easier conversion to PLC programs in IEC 61131 representation. A case study is presented for producing constructive blocks showing the advantages of the current proposition. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "An Intelligent Environment (IE) is composed by intelligent devices that interact with each other in carrying out their task, and they need to understand their contexts to provide adequate services to their users. An IE for Learning in the Cloud (IECL) is one that facilitates the location and use of educational services available in the cloud, which will be made available to users (teachers and students), resulting in an improvement of their teaching-learning process. One of the fundamental aspects for the development of IECLs, it is the contextual awareness. This paper integrates an IECL, based on Multi-Agent Systems, with services of Context Awareness, which enrich the Semantic Model of the IECL, characterized by an ontological knowledge base, which allows the agents of AmICL to take decisions adapted to the context. Particularly, through processes of ontological mining and using meta-ontologies, emerge ontological models appropriate to the context. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Mass movement in natural slopes can cause great material and human loss for society. In this context, stability analyses become quite complex since there are a large number of uncertainties involved in the interpretation of the problem. This paper presents an analysis of the stability of a highway slope, located near the city of Guarulhos, in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The shear strength parameters of the soil and the stratigraphic profile were defined based on the results of Standard Penetration Tests (SPT). The initial factor of safety was below the minimum value recommended by the Brazilian technical standards, but did not indicate imminent failure. However, additional analyses which incorporated the influence of critical periods of rain and probabilistic analysis indicated that the stability of the section was unsatisfactory. Therefore, numerical modeling is shown to be a complex and effective tool for implementation of conventional analyses of slope stability. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper studies the minimization of the cost of an air pollution control problem in a three-dimensional region where there exists several sources of pollution. Since the control area has an infinite set of points, the proposed model was formulated using semi-infinite programming (SIP). The problem was solved by using a version of Volkov\u2013Zavriev\u2019s (1997) stochastic outer approximations method, which consists of an active search for relevant constraints based in quasi-optimal functions. The concentration of the contaminant at each point in the region is obtained from a Gaussian model. Three cases were analyzed taking into account the Colombian standard for sulfur dioxide. The hypothesis that polluting sources should not be established within cities was supported. Lastly, results indicate that solutions that cost the least allow the harmful effects caused by sources in a control area to be estimated. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Three designs of shoulder geometry were evaluated with the aim to induce different distributions of thermal cycles in welding regions. Thermal cycles were measured using thermocouples and a data system acquisition. A microstructural characterization and crystallographic analysis of the welded regions were carried out using optical, scanning electron microscopy, and electron backscattering diffraction. The mechanical properties were measured by transverse tension, guided bend and hardness tests. The weldability behavior was established based on the experimental data. Results showed that the features shoulder tools produced an important effect on the thermal cycles, generating a plasticized wide region and biggest grain size in stir zone when compared with flat shoulder tool. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Traffic issues are more common every day due to the great technological development of humanity. Therefore, the control is essential to optimize infrastructure and public transport. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to make an estimate of the demand of the mobility. An alternative method, based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), has been analyzed in this work comparing to traditional prediction techniques. The aim is to obtain an estimation procedure using simple, economical input variables which are easy to find. Unlike traditional models. These new models are able to perform a better fitting of input-output mapping. The results are encouraging and therefore the ability of ANNs is shown to estimate mobility between zones. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "State space optimal controllers became popular over the last decades mainly because of its performance and robustness properties, as well as easy extension for multi-variable systems (MIMO). On the other hand, many industrial processes present dominant dead-time which may cause issues related to performance or even stability. Despite of its importance, few works from optimal control may be traced for this matter. In order to deal with dead-time effect one may use dead-time compensation (DTC) structures, mainly applied for single-variable systems (SISO). Within this context, this work proposes to modify a prediction structure recently proposed aiming to combine the best properties of both DTC and optimal control for MIMO linear systems. Simulation results along with the application to an experimental setup of a neonatal incubator prototype are presented to highlight the advantages and show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, as well as its practical aspect. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The effect of the addition of carbon nanotubes on the wettability of the lubricant was also evaluated. The results showed that the addition of carbon nanotubes at the concentrations tested led to a variation in viscosity with respect to temperature.

    "Abstract": "Imaging spectroscopy involves sensing spatial information in a scene across a range of wavelengths in order to acquire a three-dimensional data cube. Spectral images play an important role in science and technology. Some of their applications require image acquisition in both the visible and the infrared ranges in order to detect characteristics that are not noticeable to the bare eye. These can be perceived in lower layers of the scene where the visible radiation does not penetrate. This paper proposes a compressive image acquisition system that reduces the number of optical elements by jointly and compressively acquiring the images in the visible and infrared spectra. It also evaluates whether the quality of the reconstructed images is good enough to consider the optical implementation of the proposed system. Diverse simulations are performed to determine the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of the data cubes as a function of the coded apertures transmittance, the Gaussian noise applied to the measurements and the number of snapshots. The simulations provide PSNR values of up to 33 dB in the reconstructed images. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The inclusion of adaptive optics (AO) into ophthalmic imaging technology has allowed the study of histological elements of retina in-vivo, such as photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cells. The high-resolution images obtained with ophthalmic AO imaging devices are rich with information that is difficult and/or tedious to quantify using manual methods. Thus, robust, automated analysis tools that can provide reproducible quantitative information about the tissue under examination are required. Automated algorithms have been developed to detect the position of individual photoreceptor cells and characterize the RPE mosaic. In this work, an algorithm is presented for the detection of photoreceptors. The algorithm has been tested in synthetic and real images acquired with an Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) and compared with the one developed by Li and Roorda. It is shown that both algorithms have similar performance on synthetic and cones-only images, but the one here proposed shows more accurate measurements when it is used for cones-rods detection in real images. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In power plants, in addition to electricity, a lot of air pollution by exhaust gases are generated. There are many national and international standards that establish the permissible limits of different substances, but still has not been developed a mathematical expression to evaluate the environmental impact caused by all components of the exhaust gases as a whole. A method to evaluate this impact is developed in this paper. The developed mathematical expression was called \u201cemission rate\u201d. Emission rates for gas engines and fuel oil engines are offered. To get a better idea of the environmental impact of each type of engine was also developed the \u201cspecific emission index\u201d, which is the emission rate divided by the power delivered by the engine. Comparisons between specific emission rates of different engines are offered by means of a case study in a power plant in the city of Manaus. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The interaction between surface and subsurface domains in a basin can be studied using a physics-based model; however, the calibration and validation processes require a high computational effort due to their complex geometry. The authors propose an alternative to reduce the computational times during the calibration model by simplifying the geometry of the watershed that applies the equivalent rectangle concept. A quasi-3D equivalent rectangle is used to define the specific soil parameters of the Lerma river basin through sensitivity analysis that will later be applied in the calibration. The simplified model can highly accurately identify the parameter range for the initial values of the calibration process as well as if the reduction in running times is significant. Thus, the rectangle equivalent concept offers an alternative to speed-up the calibration of a 3-D fully-coupled surface sub-surface model. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This type of pavements is being used for rural lowtraffic volume roads, the type of strip road pavement used nationwide is made of reinforced-concrete, the construction in based mainly on the particular construction specification 500-1P that has only one configuration of the pavement, which raises doubts on its application for different projects. In this research, a finite element analysis was performed to study the response of concrete strip road under different load configurations and soil support. The design of plain-concrete strip roads pavements was evaluated for the maximum loads of C3 trucks and 20 years of design period. The results showed that although this type of strip road may meet fatigue criteria, the erosion criteria is uncertain due to lack of data to calibrate an erosion model to perform this evaluation. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The human visual system (HVS) can process large quantities of visual information instantly. Visual saliency perception is the process of locating and identifying regions with a high degree of saliency from a visual standpoint. Mesh saliency detection has been studied extensively in recent years, but few studies have focused on 3D point cloud saliency detection. The estimation of visual saliency is important for computer graphics tasks such as simplification, segmentation, shape matching and resizing. In this paper, we present a method for the direct detection of saliency on unorganized point clouds. First, our method computes a set of overlapping neighborhoods and estimates a descriptor vector for each point inside it. Then, the descriptor vectors are used as a natural dictionary in order to apply a sparse coding process. Finally, we estimate a saliency map of the point neighborhoods based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves similar results to those from the literature review and in some cases even improves on them. It captures the geometry of the point clouds without using any topological information and achieves an acceptable performance. The effectiveness and robustness of our approach are shown by comparing it to previous studies in the literature review. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Gully erosion is a critical issue worldwide. To correctly understand the association that the environmental data (such as climate, vegetation cover, etc.) has with soil erosion susceptibility and land uses remains a challenge in land management. This paper evaluates land use interactions with macroscopic dynamics and microscopic soil properties in terms of soil\u2019s susceptibility to erosion. We examine the reactivation of a stabilized gully in Nazareno (Brazil) by comparing field assessments with laboratory experiments, using two types of soil (well-developed soil and granite-gneiss saprolite). Both of these showed that the macroscopic behavior of soils is connected with microscopic characteristics. Well-developed soil is more erosion resistant than granite-gneiss saprolite, but the surrounding land uses do not respect these differences. These analyses enable us to explain why this and other gullies in the municipality are apparently stabilized, but soil loss continues to occur. This paper demonstrates that urban and rural expansion played a major role in triggering gully and soil losses. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Besides methane production, it was evaluated the hydrolysis (through a first-order kinetics model and the modified Gompertz model), since this is the limiting step of the A-Co of solid wastes. The results showed that A-Co of DWS with MBW is feasible and that DWS: MBW mixing ratio generated a synergistic effect in the process.

    "Abstract": "This paper reports the results of the propagation of P-waves in porous media, simulated by solving the generalized Biot\u2019s equations in finite differences. In saturated models, it was observed that when a wave advances, the maximum amplitude of the spectrum is shifted to lower frequencies, and that this maximum amplitude and its frequency are directly related. Besides this, the quality factor decreases with porosity and saturation. Hence, attenuation becomes higher when porosity, saturation, and frequency increase but tends asymptotically towards a constant value. Although phase analysis is generally discarded, it does provide interesting results. It was noted that the wave phase changes linearly with frequency at a rate of change that increases linearly with travel time. This rate increases with saturation but decreases slightly with porosity.

    "Abstract": "The paper analyses residual concrete (CW) degradation by organic acids and their potential use as nutrient source for degraded soils. The aims of the research were to carry out a chemical and mineralogical characterization of CW and to evaluate the dissolution of calcium and silicon from CW using citric acid in order to determine its potential use as a source of these elements for degraded soils. The chemical and mineralogical characterization made it possible to identify calcium and silicon as major elements associated with the concrete phases in the form of calcite, portlandite, hydrated calcium silicate, and hydrated calcium aluminosilicates. Calcium and silicon extraction was studied through a chemical and mineralogical analysis of CW (smaller than 4 mm), which was submerged in a citric acid solution for two days at 28\u00b0C and 110 rpm under controlled and uncontrolled pH conditions. Based on the concentration of calcium and silicon in solution, it was possible to conclude that after acidulation, this waste can be used as a source of nutrients for soils degraded by human use. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "As part of the search for safe and economic design criterion to line slabs of stilling basins, the present study is one of the first to calculate the center of pressure, uplift forces, and momenta from a spatiotemporal analysis of the pressures measured above and below instrumented slabs in a physical model. Controlled release of the waterstops, and variation in the dimensions of expansion joints and in the gap between foundation and the lining slab were carried out in order to consider their effects on the magnitudes of uplift forces and momenta. An offset of the center of pressure from the slab\u2019s center of gravity was identified. The objective of this work was to consider the failure mechanism induced by momentum in the slab\u2019s design. Design criterion to make the lining slab\u2019s thickness to length between 6 and 12 times the incident flow depth, is proposed, and this is compared to other design criteria. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Supported by the ability to encode information on OAM modes of light, methods and developments associated with the formulation and implementation of a data decoding architecture are shown, which uses spatial filters at nanoscale order. An Improvement to techniques for detecting the topological charge of an OAM beam is introduced. Here is reduced to the diffraction of OAM beam by a straight edge and a triangular equilateral aperture analysis; due that the use of additional optics is suppressed which would be necessary for other techniques and decreases the cost of implementation. For this purpose, physics theory of OAM beams, arguments for selecting and design components of the decoder are presented, as well as experimental details, discussions and results, showing the feasibility of the proposed method for decoding information. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a clarification model in the fuzzy sense based on the Membership Inverse Function (MIF), in Control Theory. It is considered as an identification and requires bounded input and output signals. The sign function and its derivative is regarded as a Gaussian function into the mathematical Membership description. Specifically, the sign function considers the difference between the absolute state variable values and its centroid, rather than remaining in the triangle inequality. Therefore, the theoretical result applied in Matlab\u00ae using the reference values as an identification process in an Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) (1, 1) model describes the performance. The clarification converging in almost all points of the desired signal depends on the different initial conditions. The convergence obtained by the functional error built by the second probability moment was also used and applied in the same software giving an illustrative description. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The uncertainty propagation in mechanical systems through model calculations was analyzed in this article by stochastic polynomial series of standardized random variables called Polynomial Chaos Expansion. This paper aimed to simulate the propagation of uncertainty in more complex mechanical models such viscoelastic structures which involves time dependent parameters characterization of materials, interconversion of mathematical functions through Laplace transform, and resolution of the constitutive equation through convolution integrals. The application of multi-dimensional Hermite polynomials series allowed the prediction of the randomness of the output vector. In this work it was demonstrated that a polynomial chaos expansion accurately estimated the spread of uncertainty of the random variables. The results showed that the material parameters not only affects the coefficient of variation of the displacements, but also dictates the type and spread of the tails of the probability density function for the structural output. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

A categorical multilevel factorial design was used with Design Expert\u00ae in which the following pulse treatments were defined: continuous, pulse 20:20 (on:off) and pulse 30:30 (on:off), for five minutes. Six amplitudes (30, 36, 42, 48, 54 and 60 \u00b5m) were evaluated for the following response variables: separation of phases in emulsion, temperature and accumulated power. The results showed that the best condition to obtain an emulsion with less phase separation was the 20:20 (on:off) treatment with an amplitude of 42 \u00b5m.

This type of foundation is frequently used on high-porosity and collapsible soils, which are common in many regions in Brazil. Because of the limited information available in the literature, two loading tests were performed with transversal loading in a caisson built at full scale (0.8 m diameter, 9.0 m depth, 1.6 m base diameter). A load test was performed with the soil in its natural humidity condition, and another load test was performed after the previous soil flooding. Load vs horizontal displacement curves and the horizontal direction coefficient of the soil were obtained. The results permitted the verification of the applicability of behavior-predicting theoretical formulae in addition to the proposal of parameters for use on the studied soil. Before executing the load tests, laboratory and in-situ tests were performed to investigate the local subsoil. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This study consists in the detection of changes in buildings with LIDAR technology, for which, changes in buildings are identified, classified and quantified of two study areas mapped by LIDAR sensors, using the direct comparison of multi-temporal points clouds obtained from mapping. The process begins with the correction of errors in point cloud records after two detection methods are applied: the first one is called indirect method due to the transformation of the raster data; the second one is called direct method, of vector type. When quantifying the detected buildings, an important approximation was obtained from both methods concerning the locations of these buildings and, when estimating height and area, the direct method presented higher accuracy. In conclusion, both methods are efficient tools for observation of the real estate dynamics through different time intervals. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The carbothermic reduction process is a direct reduction of sulfides. It allows a roasting in which higher concentrations of metals such as molybdenum are obtained by using both a reducing agent (in this case, carbon C) and a sulfur scavenger, such as CaO so as to prevent air toxic gases pollution such as SO2. In this paper, we analyze sulfur concentrates rich in copper, iron, and molybdenum that are obtained through rougher flotation and differential floats, which give rise to different laws. The concentrates were subjected to a carbothermic reduction process in which the working parameters were studied. The values of both the capturing agent and the reducing agent were adjusted to retain higher concentrations of sulfur. Analyzing the results obtained, the temperature was set and we reached the optimal working time and optimum molar ratio of CaO and C for the greatest recovery of metals such as molybdenum. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effect of surface acidity of fumed silica nanoparticles in adsorption and subsequent thermal cracking of Colombian asphaltenes. The acidities of the surfaces were established through Temperature Programed Desorption (TPD) experiments. The adsorption equilibrium of asphaltenes was determined using a static batch method, and the data obtained was fitted using the Langmuir model, the Freundlich model and the SLE Model. Asphaltenes catalytic oxidation experiments were conducted, and it was found that this process was surface nature dependent. In all cases, the temperature of asphaltenes oxidation was reduced regarding the virgin asphaltene sample. The effective activation energies were estimated with the iso-conversional OFW method. This energy was found to be related to adsorption affinity and asphaltenes self-association on nanoparticles surface. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This paper presents a comparison of model forecasts of demand for multiple products, choosing the best among the following: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing (ES), a Bayesian regression model (BRM), and a Bayesian dynamic linear model (BDLM). To this end, cases in which the time series is normally distributed are first simulated. Second, sales predictions for three products of a gas service station are estimated using the four models, revealing the BRM to be the best model. Subsequently, the multi-product inventory model is optimized. To define the policies for ordering, inventory, costs, and profits, a Bayesian search integrating elements of a Tabu search is used to improve the solution. This inventory model optimization process is then applied to the case of a gas service station in Colombia. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This article presents a new noncircular gear pair to obtain small shaft accelerations. The centrode contours may be controlled depending on the required maximum acceleration and smoothness of the centrodes. A comparison among elliptical, sinusoidal, and the new gears is provided. Results show that, for two-lobule gears, the maximum and minimum polar radii and gear ratios are the same for the new and sinusoidal profiles but differ for the elliptical ones. Conversely, there are significant differences in the maximum angular acceleration, tangential acceleration, and pressure angle. It is concluded that the novel gears provide not only small shaft accelerations, but also small tangential accelerations and pressure angles, and it is excepted that the elliptical gears may exhibit lower tangential accelerations and pressure angles for large values of the angular speed alternating component. Consequently, shaft and tooth loads and stresses may be lower for the new gears. This may result in more compact systems. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Calorimetric measurements for a heating-cooling cycle determine the transition temperature and enthalpy of the phases present in the KNO3compound. The effects correlated within the ionic conduction of the KNO3 compound were studied by impedance spectroscopy measurements in a frequency range from 0.1 to 10 MHz for a cooling cycle. The imaginary part of the impedance with a frequency between 200 and 100\u00b0C showed a displacement of the Debye-like peak in the lower frequency direction. This displacement indicates an increase in the relaxation times of ionic conductivity by jump. In the dielectric formalism module, the imaginary part showed an asymmetric peak as a correlation consequence in the cationic diffusion. Also the registers demonstrated that the process is thermally activated, with activation energy that is very close to the one obtained for dc conduction. From these results, it can be inferred that both, diffusion and conductivity mechanisms have the same origin. The Raman spectroscopy measurements, based on temperature (when cooling), allowed for correlation on each of the adopted phases and for changes in normal active modes of the isolated groups D2h through the evolution of the active modes \u03bd3 and \u03bd2. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The hemogram is one of the most requested medical tests as it presents details about the three cell series in the blood: red series, white series and platelet series. To make some diagnostics, the specialist must undertake the test manually, observing the blood cells under the microscope, which implies a great physical effort. In order to facilitate this work, different digital image processing techniques to detect and classify red blood cells have been proposed. However, a common problem is the presence of overlapped cells, which generate various flaws in the analysis. Therefore, the implementation of an algorithm to address the problem of red blood cells overlapped in cellular smear images is proposed in order to support the clinician in the visual reading process. The method was tested with 50 images in which the indices of sensitivity and specificity were calculated, and the effectiveness of the algorithm developed was shown. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Efficient cargo handling is a key element for a maritime port to compete and provide good service levels to its users. The performance of a port is related to ship-turnaround, which is conditioned by the ships loading and unloading operational efficiency. At the yard, containers are temporarily stacked in order to later either load them onto a ship or dispatch them to external users. Stacking has a strong impact on ships\u2019 service times. This paper proposes a container stacking policy, considering the particular characteristics of a container terminal in Chile. In order to measure the performance of the procedure, an upper bound for the number of re-handles of containers is estimated as a function of the block\u2019s capacity. Numerical results are provided in comparison to an upper bound, and a good performance by the proposed procedure is demonstrated. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This phenomenon, known as adsorption [18], can be estimated by analytical models and depends on several factors like the type of rock, degree of hydrolysis and polymer concentration, reservoir temperature, salinity of formation water, among other aspects. This paper shows the results of 144 statics tests where salinity (NaCl and CaCl2) and polymer concentration were taken as the parameters to be changed in order to determine which analytical model is the most accurate for the prediction of experimental results. The abnormal adsorption tendency with NaCl, indicates that the grater salinity value, the lesser adsorption value concentrations.

Physical characteristics of the extrudates such as expansion ratio (ER) and crispness work indicator (WC), were determined. The treatments with lower content of rice bran showed a better behavior, in terms of the physical variables. The products with higher ER and lower WC had desirable sensorial characteristics.

    "Abstract": "This article presents a methodology for a guided selection of a hydrodynamic model to study physical processes in a reservoir. It is based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria that are applied in order to study the spatial variability of the thermal structure in the Riogrande II tropical reservoir. The method consists of three main stages: i) definition and search, ii) pre-selection, and iii) selection. As a result, the DELFT3D and MIKE3 models were implemented, and the simulated temperature profiles were compared to field data that was collected between March 23rd and 27th, 2010. ELCOM was defined as a reference model, and the time series of the thermocline depth, the mixing layer depth, and its average temperature were compared with the selected models. The final selection was supported by using three different statistical parameters: the index of agreement (d1), the MAE, and the RMSE. The quantitative analysis showed that the DELFT3D model behaves better than MIKE 3. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Size controlled silver nanoparticles were obtained via chemical reduction using one-pot synthesis. Differently from other reported methods for silver nanoparticles, 1-octanol was used as both solvent and reduction agent, oleylamine and oleic acid acted as capping agents and silver nitrate was used as the metal precursor. Ultraviolet-visible and Raman spectroscopy were used to monitor the in situ growth of the nanoparticles and to corroborate the oxidation of the alcohol to caprylic acid. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) served to find the size and shape of the nanoparticles. It was found that the temperature used and the reagents proportions were appropriated to produce silver nanoparticles. A growth mechanism was proposed including the formation of silver carboxylates as an intermediate step of the reaction. As a systematic use of oleic acid, we could observe that a higher concentration of this capping agent led to smaller and more homogenous nanoparticles, less than 5nm in size. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Transformers are electrical devices that are responsible for the distribution and management of electrical power. In Latin America the recycling of silicon steel sheet transformer is very common and therefore its construction is very important because we must consider the losses that may occur by eddy currents and magnetic hysteresis especially when the team has operated under load condition. This paper proposes a novel method to determine the total losses in the single-phase distribution transformers Pole, analyzing the percentage of carbon silicon steel sheet and chemical characteristics. This diagnostic checks the iron losses in proportion to the square of the frequency induction and also applying the formula Steinmentz order to perform diagnosis and failure prediction. Although the results have approximation errors are useful for diagnosis and reuse of the silicon steel sheet, since changes in the microstructure (grain size in the nanometer scale) or ratio are significant quality B-H The contribution to the manufacturers and the industry in general is exegetical, because if they are considered the values set the standard for equipment operating under this condition, the service conditions are improved distribution networks and consequently, reliability and / or maintenance in electric utilities. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

In this paper, two new classes of capability measurements are studied as robust mechanisms to detect the influence of factors that may cause large departures from the process\u2019 engineering specifications. The behavior of the new indices was analyzed by comparing their performance to other capability measures that have been widely studied in literature. The paper aims to investigate the robustness of the new capability ratios under the presence of outliers and a lack of normality. For this purpose, bootstrap techniques were applied to detect the true potential capability of a process via statistical inference methods.

    "Abstract": "Hybrid partitioning has been recognized as a technique to achieve query optimization in relational and object-oriented databases. Due to the increasing availability of multimedia applications, there is an interest in using partitioning techniques in multimedia databases in order to take advantage of the reduction in the number of pages required to answer a query and to minimize data exchange among sites. Nevertheless, until now only vertical and horizontal partitioning have been used in multimedia databases. This paper presents a hybrid partitioning method for multimedia databases. This method takes into account the size of the attributes and the selectivity of the predicates in order to generate hybrid partitioning schemes that reduce the execution cost of the queries. A cost model for evaluating hybrid partitioning schemes in distributed multimedia databases was developed. Experiments in a multimedia database benchmark were performed in order to demonstrate the efficiency of our approach. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The variable-speed wind turbine is widely used in new wind parks and became the dominant type of wind turbine due to its technological advantages. However, in the case of already installed wind parks based on fixed speed wind turbines, the immediate migration from one technology to another becomes economically impracticable; the process of gradual modernization is more suitable. In this sense, this paper presents a detailed analysis of a mixed wind park containing both doubly fed and squirrel cage induction generators. It considers different rates of capacity for each technology and implementing the gradual replacement of some fixed speed units by variable speed units. The study addresses aspects of voltage stability, fault analysis, wind speed variation and critical fault clearance time. The network used to perform simulations is a real system from Brazil. The results show that DFIG improves the wind park behavior in many aspects and can be a cost-effective solution. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The control goal for three-phase pulse width-modulated rectifiers focuses on generating sinusoidal input currents and regulating the DC output voltage. Despite the fact that control strategies such as resonant and repetitive control have been proposed in recent works, with many notable results on the area, they have significant performance decay when the frequency changes in the exogenous signal. In this paper, it is shown that the use of an Odd Harmonic High Order Repetitive Controller can be used to control the three-phase rectifier current loops with a performance that is considerably superior to traditional alternatives developed in this field. This compensator\u2019s Odd Harmonic property keeps a computational complexity similar to that of the conventional repetitive controllers but it has the advantage of increasing the robustness when the signal frequency varies. Simulation and experimental results show the high performance that was obtained even in the case of deviation of network frequency from its nominal value. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a numerical study on the effect of the elastoplastic behavior of the material on the structural response of expanded metal tubes subjected to impact loads. The study is carried out using the finite element method, considering two material models. Firstly, a numerical model is built assuming a bilinear behavior with strain hardening. Secondly, a model is elaborated considering the speed of deformation using the correlation of Cowper-Symonds. These models are compared and validated with experimental results taken from the literature. Subsequently, a parametric study is conducted, varying the dimensions and orientation of the mesh as well as the impact speed. The results show that the response of expanded metal tubes is sensitive to changes in the orientation of the geometrical axes of the mesh. Increasing the dimensions of the strands increase the material available for plastic deformation, this, in turn, produces an increase in the energy absorbed per mass unit. In addition, the loading speed causes a delay in the response of the specimens. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Portland cement mortars were used to study the effect of the nanoparticles on the compressive and flexural strength of the cementing matrices. We found that only NS had a significant effect on the C-S-H formation for up to 21 days of hydration, and that MWCNT did not present a positive effect on the mechanical strength of mortars due to the effects of reagglomeration. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease. In the literature, there are a wide variety of mathematical and computational models to describe electric propagation during DBS; however unfortunately, there is no clarity about the reasons that justify the use of a specific model. In this work, we present a detailed mathematical formulation of the DBS electric propagation that supports the use of a model based on the Laplace Equation. Moreover, we performed DBS simulations for several geometrical models of the brain in order to determine whether geometry size, shape and ground location influence electric stimulation prediction by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Theoretical and experimental analysis show, firstly, that under the correct assumptions, the Laplace equation is a suitable alternative to describe the electric propagation, and secondly, that geometrical structure, size and grounding of the head volume affect the magnitude of the electric potential, particularly for monopolar stimulation. Results show that, for monopolar stimulation, basic and more realistic models can differ more than 2900%. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Textile industry effluents\u2014a complex mix of chemicals, among which colorants are of particular concern\u2014impose great environmental challenges. In this study, a full 23 factorial design was used for determining the best conditions for the degradation of textile dye Basic Red 46 under solid state fermentation (SSF). Three white rot fungi Trametes versicolor, Pleurotus ostreatus, and Pleurotus pulmonarius were used in the fermentation process. A maximum degradation percentage of 63.0% was achieved at 17 days of incubation with T. versicolor under a moisture content of 90%, carbon to nitrogen ratio of 12: 1, and at 20\u00b0C. P. ostreatus and P. pulmonarius reached a maximum degradation percentage of 69.3% and 63.1%, respectively, after 25 days of fermentation. The scale-up of the fermentation process using T. versicolor led to a degradation percentage of 45.7% after 30 days of incubation. Additionally, the enzyme activity of laccase, manganese peroxidase and lignin peroxidase was measured. The results indicate that SSF offers a satisfactory degradation, whose efficiency depends on the optimization of process conditions. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Various solutions that have been proposed to address the contamination problem of leather tanning wastewater at El Cerrito (Valle del Cauca, Colombia) have generated conflicts between stakeholders. Therefore, with the purpose of selecting a sustainable alternative for the reduction in chromium present in liquid effluents of the local tanning sector, the Social Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE) method was used to analyze three proposed treatment options. These consisted of a physicochemical treatment based on MgO precipitation and acid redissolution, a biotechnological treatment with native yeasts coupled to cleaner production (CP) and a nontreatment option. During the evaluation, the social, economic, environmental and technical criteria considered allowed the selection of the biotechnology alternative as the treatment option with the highest sustainability. The physicochemical alternative demonstrated low acceptance, while the nontreatment option proved unfeasible by affecting the natural environment and social component and was favored only by the economic criterion. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia. evista DYNA, 86(209), pp. 188-197, April-June, 2018, ISS.",

The Guggenheim\u2013Anderson\u2013de Boer (GAB), Peleg and Halsey models were found to adequately describe the sorption characteristics, however the Peleg model provided the best fit. The enthalpy and entropy differentials decreased with increased equilibrium moisture content. The spreading pressure increased with increased water activity but decreased with increased temperature. The net integral enthalpy decreased with increased moisture content, with an asymptotic tendency to 0.2920 kJ/mol for a moisture content of 33.4% (d.m). In contrast, the net integral entropy values were negative and increased up to 0.1687 kJ/mol for a moisture content of 29.2% (d.m). \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

These base matrices serve as a platform to generate the parity check matrices for debugging in bursts erasure through LDPC codes by superposing the base matrices and movements of circulant matrices. The construction of the matrices is performed by concatenation as it is easy to implement and has a lower randomness. To demonstrate the potential of the technique, we developed a number of simulations using low complexity encoding as well as the sum-product algorithm. Several LDPC codes (matrices) were generated and the results were compared with other approaches.

In this study, the intention was to evaluate how brain activity is directly influenced by temperature and humidity while performing a task. Therefore, a set of laboratory tests were undertaken to simulate sedentary work in two different thermal environments: 18\u00baC - 40% (cold) and 35\u00baC - 80% RH (hot). In the hot thermal environment, oscillation on Alpha waves amplitude suggests an alternation between periods of tiredness with periods in which concentration increases. Regarding Beta waves in the cold thermal environment, most of the time Beta activity is typically higher than that verified in the hot thermal environment. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

It describes how humans contribute to accidents, and pays special attention to the assurance of process safety assurance, which is in part realized by timely reactions to system alarms. An experiment involving an operator\u2019s reaction times to alarm signals was undertaken to investigate whether there are differential responses to visual as opposed to auditory alarms. The findings in the research show that visual alarm indicators are perceived faster than auditory signals. Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of errors and reaction time, indicating an individual difference in error-proneness when reacting to visual alarms in a supervisory task. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The generation of heat in underground spaces due to working activities is a factor that influences production and productivity rates. This paper analyses the heat generation in an underground mine and provides a number of approaches to enhance the ventilation conditions using electrical, instead of diesel machines. This assessment has been carried out using theoretical equations and modelling software. Investigations prove that sensible and latent heat would be reduced by around 50% and 84% respectively if the change were applied in the case study. This reduction on heat input to the ventilation system would improve the workplace environment because of lower effective temperatures and gas concentrations, which would result in better safety conditions and higher employee efficiency. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) patterns, obtained from two different aqueous colloidal suspensions of magnetite nanoparticles electrostatically stabilized with citric acid, were fitted using three different mathematical models in order to describe the particle size distribution and aggregation state. The colloidal suspensions differ in the mean particle size (4.5\u00b11.0 nm and 5.5\u00b11.1 nm) and the aqueous stabilization, allowing control of the strength of the interaction strength between particles. The models used for SAXS analysis, reveal that the particles are almost spherical with a broad size distribution, and that particles in each suspension are aggregated and are subject to an attractive interaction potential, typical for magnetic nanoparticles. For the better-stabilized sample, ramified chain-like aggregates were found, and for the less-stabilized sample, a more compact structure was determined. The size distribution obtained by applying SAXS mathematical models are in agreement with the size distribution determined using Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM). \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) develop gradually and result from professional risk factors such as the repetition of tasks, emotional overburden, inadequate posture, excessive strain, and individual and organizational/psychosocial risks. The aim of this study was to identify prevalence and symptomatology of musculoskeletal problems reported by home care service workers caring for the elderly. The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was used for the purpose. The sample contained 86 workers. The results show a high prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in different anatomical areas, affecting in particular the upper limbs and the lumbar, dorsal and cervical areas. There are also some important associations between the dorsal area and the lifting of patients weighing above 90 kg. It may be concluded that these workers run a considerable risk of acquiring musculoskeletal injuries as a result of their working conditions and from the ways in which their activities are currently performed. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Thermal barrier coatings (TBC) were manufactured by thermal spraying of CoNiCrAlY and YSZ powders, which constituted the bond coat (BC) and top coat (TC), respectively. The BC was deposited on stainless steel substrates by a high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) systemwhilst the TC was deposited on the BC by an atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) gun. TBCs were heat treated at 1200 \u00b0C for 8 and 16 h in order to determine the evolution of the residual stress state as a function of time. The residual stress profiles were obtained by employing the Modified Layer Removal Method (MLRM) and an adaptation of this for bilayer coatings called Modified Layer Removal Method for Duplex Coatings (MLRMDC). It was observed that as the exposure time was increased, the compressive residual stresses increased, which was more noticeable in the BCs. The TBCs without heat treatment revealed tensile residual stresses. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Three iron sources (FeSO4, Fe2(SO4)3 and FeCl3) at different concentrations (150, 700 and 1250 mg Fe/L) were evaluated on large coal particle biodesulfurization processes at Erlenmeyer level. A consortium of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (ATCC 23270) and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans (ATCC 15494) was used in all the assays. By using 150 mg Fe2+/L (from FeSO4), pyrite biooxidation was 31.14% after 12 days. When Fe2(SO4)3 replaced FeSO4, oxidation improved by 21.16%. The assays using the highest concentrations of sulphate sources also obtained the same increase. However, Fe2(SO4)3 assays had a better sulphate removal from coal. This suggests that using the smallest concentration of Fe2(SO4)3 is a good alternative to boost the pyrite oxidation rate and avoid the formation of precipitates. Additionally, biooxidation in the FeCl3 assays decreased, indicating, a priori, that the microorganisms were not able to adapt properly to Cl- ions. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The world's population is aging at an unprecedented rate, this demographic shift will change all aspects of life, including work. The aging of the worforce and a higher percentage of workers who will work past traditional retirement years presents significant challenges and opportunities for employers. Older workers are a valuable resource, but in order to ensure they stay in good health, prevention will be key. Wearable technologies are quickly becoming ubiquitous, individuals are turning to them to monitor health, activities and hundreds of other quantifiable occurences. Wearable technologies could provide a new means for employers to tackle the challenges associated with an aging workforce by creating a wide spectrum of opportunities to intervene in terms of aging employees and extend their working lives by keeping them safe and healthy through prevention. Employers are already making standing desks available, and encouraging lunch time exercise, is it feasible for Wearables to make the jump from a tool for individuals to a method for employers to ensure better health, well-being and safety for their employees? The aim of this work is to lay out the implications for such interventions with Wearable technologies (monitoring health and well-being, oversight and safety, and mentoring and training) and challenges (privacy, acceptability, and scalability). While an ageing population presents significant challenges, including an aging work force, this demographic change should be seen, instead, as an opportunity rethink and innovate workplace health and take advantage of the experience of older workers. The Quantified-Self and Wearables can leverage interventions to improve employees\u2019 health, safety and well-being. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This article presents an alternative for resolving the existing vulnerability of systems that implement masking by means of chaotic synchronization. This system avoids detection of the parameters used as the cipher key by an attacker on implementing encryption by means of synchronized chaotic-phase masks of the R\u00f6ssler oscillator, for encoding and establishing synchronization among transmitter-receiver devices. In addition, it employs two ciphering keys: the first, with a recommended length of 2,048 characters, and the second, which is used as an initial value. Both keys are employed for continual modification of one of the oscillator\u2019s parameters. This strengthens the security system and avoiding an attacker from obtaining the oscillator\u2019s parametric values by calculating the least average synchronization error. The use of the system developed provides a cipher, which is resistant to statistical attacks. In addition, our system validates the data of the transmitter device (username, password, etc.) in order to authorize transmission. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The authors propose a new hardening rule for constitutive models based on the subloading concept. This concept allows a smooth transition between unloading and reloading. Most importantly it characterizes the soil with a single set of parameters regardless of its initial density state. The new rule aims to improve the original model proposed by the last author. The original version included a linear evolution rule for the sake of simplicity, but did not include any empirical evidence for such law. This new version proposes an exponential law that provides a better fit to the experimental data. This law requires only two parameters with a clear physical interpretation. These parameters can be obtained from simple one-dimensional compression tests. The model was based on controlled tests performed with glass spheres, but was applied to real granular and clay soils. The results show that the model can very successfully reproduce the behavior of real soils. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The morphology and composition of the coating were verified by Scanning Electron Microscope and X-Ray Diffraction. Hardness and adhesion of the coating were also studied. In the erosion-corrosion wear, a slurry jet with impingement angle 90\u00b0 at 4 and 8 m/s was used to impact upon bare and coated steel. All the wear mechanisms were evaluated according to ASTM G-119. The results indicate that the synergism wear rate is the most aggressive wear component, exceeding 40% of the total mass loss for coating steel and 60% of mass loss for bare steel. An increase in the impact velocity increases mass loss for both bare and coated steel. In comparison, the Cr/CrN coating had better corrosion and erosion\u2013corrosion resistance. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Textural characteristics (TPA), ionic strength (IS) and cooking losses (CL) were evaluated. The results indicated that the lowest cooking losses were found when reducing the NaCl content by using the highest TPPNa levels (T2, T4, T6 and T9). Furthermore, formulations with larger amounts of TPPNa and TKPP (T2, T3 and T6) had the highest values of for hardness, cohesiveness and chewiness.

    "Abstract": "This study concerns the application of enzymatic hydrolysis to modifying starchy and cellulosic materials. Corn, cassava, upright elephant ear and sugarcane bagasse were used in order to evaluate the influence of the enzymatic hydrolysis over the structural, thermal stability and crystallinity of these materials. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to evaluate the thermal properties while Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) methods were used for the structural and morphological analysis. Corn presented the highest starch yield (g of starch/g of raw material) with 40.4%. For all materials used, the crystallinity increased due to enzymatic hydrolysis suggesting that amorphous zones are attacked first. The gelatinization temperature of the starches increased as the crystallinity increased. The granules and fibers, except for upright elephant ear starch, did not change their size with enzymatic treatment and the superficial area did not increase significantly with the enzymatic treatment. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The study of human body size and shape has been a topic of research for a very long time. In the past, anthropometry used traditional measuring techniques to record the dimensions of the human body and reported variance in body dimensions as a function of mean and standard deviation. Nowadays, the study of human body dimensions can be carried out more efficiently using three-dimensional body scanners, which can provide large amounts of anthropometric data more quickly than traditional techniques can. This paper presents a description of the broad range of issues related to the collection of anthropometric data using three-dimensional body scanners, including the different types of technologies available and their implications, the standard scanning process needed for effective data collection, and the possible sources of measurement errors that might affect the reliability and validity of the data collected. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This article presents a management algorithm to adjust the operation and recharge conditions of electric vehicles in real time, optimizing the use of network capacity and improving the voltage profile through the coordination of recharges depending on loss sensitivity; an approach to identify nodes where power losses can decrease or increase under a specific load condition. The results obtained by applying the strategy are presented through a random consumption model of vehicles based on existing mobility patterns using a distribution circuit of 628 nodes. This allows the identification of electric vehicle penetration after which it becomes necessary to implement the proposed management scheme. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Chemical process and automation of data collection for industrial processes are known to result in auto-correlated data. The independence of observations is a basic assumption made by traditional tools that are used for the statistical monitoring of processes. If this is not adhered to then the number of false alarms and quality costs are increased. This research considers the use of variable parameters (VP) charts in the presence of autocorrelation. The objective is to determine the impact on the detection velocity and false alarms of different degrees of autocorrelation and their interaction with process conditions\u2014the aim being to effectively select parameters. The VP chart showed improvements in its performance when detecting large average runs as the autocorrelation coefficient increased in contrast with the traditional variable sample interval (VSI) and x quality systems.

Along with technological advances, there is the need to improve knowledge of safety and health and apply that knowledge to the workplace. The \u201csafety-by-design\u201d approaches are attracting attention as helpful tools to develop safer products and production processes. The Systematic Design Analysis Approach could help to identify the solutions to control workplace risks by defining the emission and exposure scenarios and the possible barriers to interrupt them. When managing risks during a photocatalytic ceramic tiles development project, it was possible to identify relevant nanoparticles emission scenarios and related barriers. Possible ways to reduce them could then be defined, which would in turn, lead to an inherently safer production process. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The efficiency of a Weibull demonstration test plan is completely determined by the total experimental time (Ta), which depends on the unknown sample size (n) and on the Weibull shape parameter (\u03b2). Thus, once \u03b2 was selected, Ta depends only on n. Unfortunately, because n was estimated by the parametrical binomial approach, then if the confidence level C was higher than 0.63, n, and as consequence Ta, was overestimated, (For C&lt;0.63, they were underestimated). On the other hand, in this paper, because the intersection between n and \u03b2, for which Ta was unique, was found with n depending only on R(t), then the estimation of Ta was optimal. On the other hand, since once \u03b2 was selected, \u03b7 was completely determined, then \u03b2 and \u03b7 were used to incorporate the expected failure times of the operational level in an accelerated life test analysis (ALT).

Pressures were measured in a physical model constructed in the Hydraulic Laboratory of the Universidad del Valle in Cali, Colombia. Details such as expansion joints, waterstops, slab thickness, and soil-slab separation were simulated. Inflow was full and partially developed, with Froude numbers ranging from 2.84 to 11.6. The role of the expansion joints and waterstops in the generation of uplift pressure and hydraulic gradient below the slab were identified using pressure fields above and below the slab, in multiple tests. The results of this research are critical for the design of bottom slabs in hydraulic structures, which are required to withstand uplift forces and prevent internal erosion problems. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In countries with tropical climates, such as Brazil, the high summer temperatures associated with high relative humidities are a stress factor in animal production. Excessive heat within a poultry facility causes a reduction in feed intake and production, and increased bird mortality. With the knowledge that about 75% of the radiant heat load within a facility comes from the roof, it is necessary to study alternatives that can minimize this radiation. Thus, the objective of the present work is to analyze the thermal environment inside physical broiler housing models constructed on a reduced scale (1:10), where the thermal comfort was evaluated by the black globe humidity index (BGHI) and radiant heat load (RHL). Five models built with different roofing materials were evaluated. Based on the results, it can be concluded that roofs constructed with the channel clay roofing tile (TB30), natural fiber tiles with their external side painted white (TFVP15) and tiles made of recycled long-life packaging (TLV15), provide better thermal environments within the models. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "A non-invasive method useful for asset management is to estimate the functional age of the insulating paper of the transformer that is caused by thermal aging. For this purpose, the hot-spot temperature profile must be assessed by means of some transformer characteristics, the historical load, ambient temperature profiles and a set of equations. In many in-service unit cases, the available data is incomplete. This paper proposes a method to deal with the lack of data. The method is based on the estimation of the historical load and ambient temperature profiles by using an artificial neural network and Monte Carlo simulations. The probable loss of total life percentage of a 30 MVA power transformer is obtained through the proposed method. Finally, the corresponding results for the assessed transformer, a model validation section and conclusions are presented. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The surfaces of a personalized maxillofacial prosthesis were manufactured in a relatively short period of time and at a moderate cost. The surface topography was generated with a Computer-Aided Design system from the Computerized Axial Tomography of a maxillofacial area. The design of the machining manufacturing process, its simulation and verification, were facilitated by the use of a virtual machine tool equivalent to the real machine tool available. Finally, the manufacturing process was successfully achieved by using a conventional 3-axis vertical machining center equipped with a fourth external rotational axis. Using a 3-axis machine tool with an additional axis is less expensive than using a 5-axis machine. There is abundant literature on machining of free-form surfaces using a 5-axis machine tool, but there are few precedents for the manufacturing of this kind of surface using a 4-axis machine. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents the analysis of nanorefrigerant fluids to improve the thermal efficiency of a refrigeration system. Simulations in ANSYS FLUENT 15.0 were performed with mixtures of refrigerants R113, R123 and R134a, with Al2O3 nanoparticles at 1 vf% and 5 vf% (vf%, fraction volume concentration), flowing through a horizontal tube with a constant wall temperature. A mixture and the k-e turbulent models were employed to obtain results of heat transfer coefficient, temperature and pressure drop for each case. Results show an increment in thermal characteristics by adding 1 vf% and 5 vf% of Al2O3 nanoparticles to the three refrigerants selected. However, the size of the nanoparticle does not affect the thermal properties of nanofluid and the pressure drop does not show a specific pattern of behavior at different concentrations of nanoparticles. Finally, the mixture of R134a with 30 nm of mean diameter size Al2O3 at 1 vf% was selected because of its higher thermal efficiency and its favorable properties as a refrigerant. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The main objective of this study is to analyze the perception of Occupational Health and Safety in small construction projects in the Brazilian construction industry. The adopted approach is qualitative in nature and seeks to understand the character of the current practices through interviews held with \u2018actors\u2019 who are directly involved in small-scale building sites, as well as with others who are involved in large-scale work sites. In Brazil, there is a weakness in supervision at small construction projects. This is due to numerous factors, such as the low visibility of these types of works and short deadlines, as well as the lack of knowledge about Occupational Health and Safety. This study reinforces and illustrates the idea of the inherent dangers involved in the occupational health of workers in small construction projects. It also indicates that there is a need to put greater emphasis on compliance with Occupational Health and Safety principles, which are covered by the current Brazilian Legislation and Regulatory Standards. This should be undertaken in order to ensure that the work in small-scale building sites is more visible and, especially, to ensure acceptable health and safety conditions for construction workers. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Freight transport is widely studied due to its impact on logistics costs and service levels of enterprises. Looking for network configurations that improve some of these aspects will always be attractive to both academics and businesses. The collaborative distribution system was proposed using the IRP model, and it was compared with the scenarios in which the both supplier or customers optimize their inventory levels. For the IRP model solution a genetic algorithm was used, from which it was obtained a collaborative distribution system with a better performance than if the optimization is made independently. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The recession curves of hydrographs provide information about these hydrogeological processes and they are useful to assess an insight in the storage-discharge relationship in subsurface reservoirs. In this study, the physic base and the nonlinearity relationship of storagedischarge were analyzed through a mathematical expression which describe a master recession curve. Four numerical algorithms were applied to estimate the baseflow of the Surat\u00e1\u2019s River basin and the high Oro\u2019s River basin, Santander-Colombia. In both cases, master recession curves showed the nonlinearity relationship in storage-discharge.

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to propose a correlation for the hydraulic parameters of pervious concrete (PC). Thus, three aggregates from civil construction waste and one basalt aggregate (reference) were used to produce PC. The ratio c/a (cement: aggregate) 1:3.26 and a w/c ratio of 0.34 were used in all mixtures. Compressive and flexure tensile strength tests were performed to mechanically characterize the mixtures produced, whereas porosity and constant head permeability tests were also carried out to assess the material hydraulic properties. Firstly, the experimental results were compared with the requirements established in international guidelines (ACI 522R-10, NBR 16416 (2015) and VTT-R-080225-13). The results complied with the guidelines indicating it is feasible to produce pervious concretes with the sustainable aggregates used in the study in low structural applications such as walkways. On the other hand, a correlation between permeability and porosity was proposed based on Darcy\u2019s and Bernoulli\u2019s laws. The proposed equation, obtained by means of a non-linear regression, is an exponential equation that characterizes the hydraulic efficiency of the internal channels of the material considering the pores interconnection. The correlation between porosity and permeability was finally validated using results from the literature showing the same trend found in laboratory, and therefore it was demonstrated that the proposed correlation in an efficient tool to predict the hydraulic efficiency of pervious concrete. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The effect of different pretreatments on the mineral with oxidizing agents such as KMnO4 and NaClO was evaluated. Studies of equilibrium and kinetics of adsorption showed that the mechanism fits well to the Langmuir isotherm and its kinetics to a model of pseudo-second order. At the conditions studied was found that the adsorption capacity for the mineral modified with KMnO4 and NaOCl were 59.209 and 51.279 mg/g respectively.

Representative examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the formulation in accordance with building code requirements for structural concrete (ACI 318S-13), including the comments on the standards. A comparison is made between the optimal design solution and current design practice for reinforced rectangular concrete beams. The optimal solution for the design of reinforced rectangular concrete beams shows clearly that significant savings can be made in the costs of the construction materials used-i.e. reinforcement steel and concrete. In addition, the problem formulation can be applied using a nonlinear mathematical programming format. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

According to European Statistics on Accidents at Work framework (ESAW), important variables related to the main circumstances of accidents are being gathered in Europe. The purpose of this paper is to present a method for analysis of accident databases that are coded according to the ESAW and based on Multiple Correspondence Analysis. The method proposed considers the implicit conceptual relationship between the exposure and accident variables in order to identify main areas for public policy intervention. This method is presented by analyzing specific working processes using a dataset of the accidents that were reported in the Andalusian manufacturing over a ten-year period. The method presented allowed easy identification of the main associations candidates for public intervention programs.

The kind of dependence is a non-linear one, and the test is known as cross-bicorrelation, which is associated with Brooks and Hinich [1]. We study dependence periods between U.S. Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 (SP500), used as a benchmark, and six Latin American stock market indexes: Mexico (BMV), Brazil (BOVESPA), Chile (IPSA), Colombia (COLCAP), Peru (IGBVL) and Argentina (MERVAL). We have found windows of nonlinear dependence and comovement between the SP500 and the Latin American stock markets, some of which coincide with periods of crisis, leading to an interpretation of a possible contagion or interdependence. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Risk assessment is an essential tool to support risk decisions. However, this process may not always be applied effectively, and this can limit the quality of the preventative action. This is particularly critical in sectors that have a lot of micro and small companies, such as Olive Oil Mills (OOMs). To better understand how to improve the quality of the risk assessment at OOMs, this study aims to analyze the views of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) practitioners on the key difficulties/limitations in this process and identify some improvements to current practices. This analysis was based on a questionnaire that was developed and given to 13 OSH practitioners working for OOMs. The results showed that the time available to perform the risk assessment is the major limitation. The need for a specific tool for risk assessment in the OOM sector was identified, and the use of accident reports from the entire sector was indicated as an alternative to the absence of data at company level. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The carbonation of hydrated ordinary Portland cement (OPC) allows the transformation of hydrated calcium aluminates and silicates into calcium carbonate and amorphous silica/ alumina. These carbonated materials are appropriate to being used as inorganic precursors for alkaline activation. The use of sodium silicate and hydroxide solutions enables the production of cementitious gels. Two ways of carbonation of hydrated cement were studied: in a dry environment, where relative humidity did not exceed 70% and in an aqueous medium at a temperature of 5 \u00b1 1 \u00b0 C. Both materials were micro-structurally characterised and they have been used for the manufacturing of geopolymeric mortars. These mortars reached mechanical strength between 10 and 20 MPa, depending on the activating solution, the water/binder ratio and curing time/temperature. These results show the feasibility of reusing hydrated cement contained in construction and demolition wastes. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Foods may have both solid and liquid properties, and are described as viscoelastic products. Knowledge on such viscoelastic features is very useful for quality control and/or food stability. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of the application of 1-MCP on the viscoelastic properties of minimally processed yellow pitahaya during refrigeration storage, by using a stress relaxation test. Viscoelastic parameters were determined through Generalized Maxwell and Peleg\u2019s rheologic models. Both rheological models proved suitable to predict viscoelastic behavior; however, Peleg\u2019s model better described this behavior. Samples of treated and non-treated pitahaya with 1-MCP decreased their elastic behavior (firmness decrease) during storage. Fruit treated with 1-MCP showed a greater elastic component than non-treated samples during storage. These two rheological models were suitable for predicting the viscoelastic behavior, however. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

SEZs have multiple labor and fiscal benefits that allow them to enhance the economic level of the region through the generation of quality jobs, export growth, government investment, and technology transfer, just to name a few. China and other countries have demonstrated the benefits of SEZs and their economic impact on the local region. This article proposes a method based on Integer Linear Programming to delineate SEZs in a way that takes into account the population of the region, the distance and travel time between municipalities, the infrastructure of the region, and the Federal Laws imposed by the government.

    "Abstract": "This work focused on the design, development and construction of a new low cost soldering iron that works by means of induction heating. The amount of electronic components has been minimized in order to reduce production costs. Additional tests were undertaken to determine the ideal tips for soldering, and the adaptations necessary to guarantee self-regulation using a nickel foil shield (due to its low curie temperature) are suggested. The new device contains a resonant inverter able to generate alternating magnetic fields of 100 kHz at the center of an 18-turn coil; the inverter is controlled only using an astable oscillator circuit. The paper examines criteria to select suitable soldering-tips by experimentally determining their equivalent resistance heating it within the resonant inverter or well, another one by using a rapid magnetic test. The system represents a good tool, suitable for the manufacture of development boards or electronic tasks. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Mixtures with a 10% (by weight) addition as a replacement for cement at w/b ratios of 0.45 and 0.65 were prepared. Test specimens were exposed to carbonation in a chamber under controlled conditions (1% CO2, 65%RH, and 25\u00b0C), until reaching two levels of carbonation (50% and 100%). ER was applied for a period of 15 days using sodium carbonate as the electrolyte and a current density of 1 A/m2. From the evaluated additions, MK is highlighted, which generated a resistance increase of 53.51% relative to that of the reference mixture and contributes to improvements of durability properties.

Subsequently various modifications were made using a surface passivation process in liquid phase with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), using two loads of TEOS and three passivation cycles, in order to obtain six catalysts. These materials were characterized by NH3-TPD and tested in tolune disproportionation reaction, under different conditions of pressure and temperature. As modification cycles were increased for each catalyst, there was a change in the acidity of the solids, mainly due to deposition of an inert layer of silica on the external surface. These results were confirmed with the improvement in para-selectivity and decreasing in conversion. Despite zeolite Beta is a large pore zeolite, an improvement of the para-selectivity was obtained, achieving almost stable values for the entire range of temperature and pressure conditions. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The prevalence of obesity is increasing throughout the workforce. Manual lifting tasks are common and can produce significant muscle loading. This study compared muscular activity between obese and non-obese subjects, using surface Electromyography (EMG), during manual lifting. Six different lifting tasks (with 5, 10 and 15 kg loads in free and constrained styles) were performed by 14 participants with different obesity levels. EMG data normalization was based on the percentage of Maximum Contraction during each Task (MCT). Muscle Activation Times (AT) before each task were also evaluated. The study suggests that obesity can increase MCT and delay muscle AT. These findings reinforce the need to develop further studies focused on obesity as a risk factor for the development of musculoskeletal disorders. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Currently, there is a broad portfolio of agile approaches to software development, however, in many cases their implementation is done informally and without a proper institutionalization of the agile values and principles. Although there are some proposals related to the adoption and assessment of agile approaches, efforts have been made without having a common terminology which has led to confusion and terminological conflict affecting the implementation of these approaches in organizations. This article proposes the ontology called OntoAgile, which aims to suggest a common and consistent terminology that allows sharing the knowledge generated around the implementation of the agile approaches in the software processes in a generic and formal way. Similarly, OntoAgile facilitates the assessment of the agility of the software processes from the identification of the relationships between the elements of the software processes and the agile principles and values. OntoAgile was assessed satisfactorily by three cases of application. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The early Cretaceous Ci\u00e9naga Marbles that crop out in the NW foothills of the Santa Marta Massif (Colombian Caribbean region) present an epigenetic mineral assemblage (skarn-type), overprinting the metamorphic mineral assemblage previously developed along the regional metamorphic history that affected this unit. The skarn-type mineralogy allows at least three paragenetic contexts to be distinguished, which are represented by the following neoformed minerals: (a) garnet, forsterite, diopside, titanite, wollastonite and calcite (early anhydrous metamorphic stage), (b) actinolite, tremolite, allanite and clinohumite (metasomatic or hydrated stage), and (c) chlorite, serpentine, sepiolite and quartz (late low temperature retrograde stage, probably due to infiltration of descending meteoric waters). The skarn-type mineralogy is observed as alteration halos developed around porphyritic granodiorites emplaced as sills between anisotropy planes related to metamorphic regional foliation of rock that are considered to be the causative bodies of the skarntype mineralogy. Zircon U-Pb ages obtained from granodioritic bodies yielded an age of 55.5\u00b10.7 Ma (Ypresian, Early Eocene). The formation of the skarn-type mineralogy in the Ci\u00e9naga Marbles is temporarily related to the formation and emplacement of hydrated silicate masses that were generated at the beginning of the subduction polarity change (i.e. when the Caribbean oceanic plate began to subduct beneath South American continental plate). \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper details the design and implementation of a simultaneous dual true random numbers generator using only one laser and a digital signal processing system with a DE0 Nano FPGA. We implemented the random generator in such a way that a vacuum optical field will exist in our system. Taking advantage of the inherently random nature of the field, simultaneously quadrature components are measured in order to generate a truly random voltage signal. Also, we used a dynamical system of statistical analysis to eliminate any residual component of direct current on output voltage signal due to an (unavoidable) optical power imbalance in the optical system that was implemented. Finally, were measured the parameters of the auto-correlation and bias probability with values of 0.00010, 0002, respectively, which means that our system can be considered as a true random sequence generator capable of producing two sequences in an independent manner with a bit rate of up to 25 MHz. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The use of Cu and Ti in Zn alloys improves mechanical properties as solid solution and dispersoid particles (grain refiners) may harden the material and reduce creep deformation. This is one of the main design problems for parts made with Zn alloys, even at room temperature. In this work the mechanical behavior of a Zn-Cu-Ti low alloy is presented using tensile tests at different strain rates, as well as creep tests at different loads to obtain the value of the strain rate coefficient m in samples parallel and perpendicular to the rolling direction of the Zn strip. The microstructure of the alloy in its raw state, as well as heat treated at 250\u00b0C, is also analyzed, as the banded structure produced by rolling influences the strengthening mechanisms that can be achieved through the treatment parameters. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of the Saraz method in order to quantify ammonia emissions generated in opened or hybrid animal production facilities, and to determine an equation for the adjustment method. To do this, we developed beacon equipment, with input and output gas sectors, hoods and absorbent porous material. After the collection, the amount of ammonia captured in the environment was determined in the laboratory. Different ammonia concentrations were evaluated in addition to the different speeds of the exhaust air. Considering the results, it can be concluded that for the situations analyzed the Saraz method is efficient, but as with other methods, with an increase of air velocity and concentration, its efficiency decreases. An equation for the adjustment of the Saraz method was generated to determine the concentration and the rate of ammonia emissions inside animal facilities. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "By using the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) micro X-rays diffraction (\u03bcXRD) and scanning electron microscopy, the structural characterization of minerals is far more reliable and accurate. The identification and elemental and compositional quantification of minerals by these non-destructive techniques improve the quality of the results and allow a full analysis of the material. The data obtained by these techniques revealed the presence of garnet-type spessartine, in addition to trace elements and compounds that form the overall material. The structural refinement of spessartine was performed using the Rietveld method from data obtained by conventional diffraction and by using the MDI RIQAS analysis software. With the data acquired by \u03bcXRD using an area detector, a shorter exposure time (compared to that required by the 0L and 1D detectors) was achieved, and there was no need for particle size reduction of the mineral. It was also possible to identify the spessartine and other compounds in smaller concentrations (in situ measurements). By combining scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques, both worked from a characterization point of view. The examination by micro X-ray diffraction did not require physical separation of the sample. Using this information and the above advanced analytical techniques, the identification of garnet can be undertaken much more reliably. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Data Envelopment Analysis is a non-parametrical approach for efficiency evaluation of so-called DMUs (Decision Making Units) and takes into account multiple inputs and outputs. For each inefficient DMU, a target is provided which is constituted by the inputs or outputs levels that are to be attained for the inefficient DMU to become efficient. However, multiobjective models, known as MORO (Multiobjective Model for Ratio Optimization) provide a set of targets for inefficient DMU, which provides alternatives among which the decision-maker can choose. In this paper, we proposed an extension of the MORO models to take into account non-discretionary variables, i.e., variables that cannot be controlled. We present a numerical example to illustrate the proposed multiobjective model. We also discuss the characteristics of this model, as well as the advantages of offering a set of targets for the inefficient DMUs when there are non-discretionary variables in the data set. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The stages of the supply chain used were cane planting, production and the distribution process. The residues taken into account were bagasse and vinasse. Moreover, four simulation scenarios were performed in which the values of variables modified management strategies. The installed bioethanol production capacity was increased to observe the evolution of increased waste generation evaluated. The initial conditions for the simulation were modified to represent a production of about 2,500,000 liters / day. This leads to an increased generation of vinasse of over 400 million liters on average in a month and around more than 1 million tones of bagasse. The results are used to estimate the impact of management strategies on the amount of waste generated in the production of bioethanol. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The coded aperture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI) is an optical architecture that captures spectral images using compressive sensing. This system improves the sensing speed and reduces the large amount of collected data given by conventional spectral imaging systems. In several applications, it is necessary to analyze changes that occur between short periods of time. This paper first presents a sparsity analysis for spectral video signals, to obtain accurate approximations and better comply compressed sensing theory. The use of the CASSI system in compressive spectral video sensing then is proposed. The main goal of this approach is to capture the spatio-spectral information of dynamic scenes using a 2-dimensional set of projections. This application involves the use of a digital micro-mirror device that implements the traditional coded apertures used by CASSI. Simulations show that accurate reconstructions along the spatial, spectral and temporal axes are attained, with PSNR values of around 30 dB. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, nanoparticles of zinc oxide were synthesized; they were formed using the sol-gel method (citrate route) at calcination temperatures (Tc) of 500, 550 and 600 \u00b0C. For all samples studied, IR spectroscopy showed the presence of the bands associated with water molecules present in the zinc oxide and carbon dioxide adsorbed on its surface. The formation of zinc oxide phase was confirmed by XRD, which showed that from 500 \u00baC it had this type of Wurtzite structure. However, samples calcinated at 600 \u00baC have higher crystallinity. Crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer equation. The Rietveld method was used to obtain lattice parameters a and c for Wurtzite cell types as well as cell volume and the ratio c/a of each sample. These parameters do not show significant changes when they are compared with values obtained from samples with different calcination temperatures. Electron paramagnetic resonance showed the presence of defects in the zinc oxide. Three signals with g values of 1.96, 2.00 and 2.04 were associated with oxygen and zinc vacancies. Defects in the structure disappear when the calcination temperature is increased. The sample that was highlighted with the highest concentration of vacancies has a mean crystallite size greater than 30 nm, and this may also be responsible for this feature. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Work stress increasingly affects many workers from different countries. Conditions such as high demand, low social support and low job control are considered predictors of increased stress. With data obtained from the V European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) a Bayesian network model was made. It provides information on the levels of stress in relation to model demand-control-social support (DCS), differentiating into work situations as they are, self-employed, private and public. To deepen understanding of the interrelationships between these variables sensitivity analysis of individual and overall were performed to check the DCS model assumptions. This model applied in the V EWCS identified the variations and similarities between different work situations, proving that having low levels of demand, together with control and high social support, the likelihood of stress decreases. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The main objective of the project management team is to implement the project taking into consideration the Budget, schedule and constraints. In addition, project accomplishment, especially with large projects, requires the project to be correctly envisaged. Earned value (EV) management is a valuable technique for analyzing and controlling the performance of the project and predicting the total cost before its completion. Thus, fuzzy systems such as Adaptive Network based on the Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Parallel Structure based on the Fuzzy System (PSFS) are used to predict the project completion time. In this paper, the plan value diagram is used to predict the earn value diagram using three methods. These three methods are based on the PSFS and Neural Networks (NNs), which help with the implementation of the projects in organizations. The results of these three methods decreased the prediction error of the EV diagram by up to 2%. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this article, we propose an extended fault positions method combined with the Monte Carlo method to evaluate voltage sags. The distribution function SARFI is obtained by taking into account the randomness of (i) location of faults in lines, (ii) generation dispatch, and (iii) the prefault voltage. Voltage magnitudes are calculated with power flow, while noting changes in the generation dispatch, the load, and the topology of the area of vulnerability (AOV). The method is tested in the Atlantic coast area of the National Interconnected Power System of Colombia. The distribution of the number of voltage sags per year with the magnitude in bus bars and the impact of generation on the voltage sags are determined. With a higher number of plants dispatched, voltage sags caused by faults are less severe due to the robustness of the power system and the voltage support. Operation with coupled bars had a greater impact on voltage sags compared to uncoupled bars. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "A good rheological characterization can be used as a control parameter within the industrial processing of kaolin. The kaolin used was characterized by SEM, XRD, XRF and particle size. Also it was classified and separated in three sizes of fine material, which was introduced in suspensions with three different size distributions. The analysis was based on a rheological study of the fine particles influence, on the suspension viscosity. The results show that it is possible to modify the viscosity by altering the fines content without changing the solid fraction of the suspension. Suspensions of kaolin with 40% content of fines tend to decrease its viscosity value. Suspensions with quantities of fine greater than 60%, increase the value of its viscosity. In the research are also presented the proposed mechanisms by which the presence of fine increases or decreases the value of the viscosity of a suspension. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The FA100 system is based on fly ash (FA), which has an elevated content of unburned material (14.8%). The FA/OPC system is comprised of a mixture of fly ash and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) at a proportion of 80/20. The thermal performance was evaluated by several tests, such as exposure to high temperatures (up to1000\u00b0C) and direct flame resistance. In addition, the effect of cyclic exposure was studied at 700\u00b0C for 10 cycles. FA/OPC hybrid material retains 92% of its initial strength and FA100 retains 113.3% of its initial strength at 700\u00b0C. Both materials can withstand 10 exposure cycles with a strength loss of less than 45%. In direct flame exposure, a temperature gradient of about 500\u00b0C was observed. These results indicate that these types of materials could possibly be used as fire-resistant materials in civil structures. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Three drying methods were compared: lyophilization, convection drying, and microwave assisted convection drying. Subsequently six formulations were made varying the amount of pectin from 0.5 to 2.5%, water, inulin, glycerol and ascorbic acid. The results obtained showed that microwave-assisted convection drying at 40 \u00b0 C for the shell showed a higher concentration of fiber. Two formulations were selected for physicochemical, microbiological and sensory analysis. Formulation D with a higher percentage of pectin was more widely accepted. The values obtained from vitamin C and total phenolic compounds show that the formulation of a fruit bar is feasible, taking advantage of the shell mainly as a raw material for foods with functional characteristics. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

It is therefore necessary to undertake a suitable characterization of those events to conduct studies that permit the causes and possible mitigation techniques to be identified. This work describes the development of monitoring modules to characterize voltage sags and swells that could be used in Electromagnetic Transients Programs - EMTP (for example the ATP - Alternative Transients Program). The implemented module uses a novel method to characterize these disturbances. The results of the implementation show that the voltage sags and swells are appropriately characterized; furthermore, less sampled data is required from a voltage signal with respect to the conventional RMS voltage method. This could optimize the capture and analysis process of information in power quality monitoring. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Material\u2019s Young modulus can be estimated from this test; however, there is not enough available information about the distribution of the strain energy inside the sample during the deformation process. The proposed methodology seeks to give insight into the deformation process. Experimental results for a cured silicon rubber sample were used to validate the simulation results. It was found that the estimation of the Young modulus with the punch shear test depends on the ratio between the span-to-punch diameters. This conclusion applies to the simulated results, following Timoshenko\u2019s theory for the deformation of thin plates.

    "Abstract": "The main objective of this work is to compute the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis for a region of Mexico using a new ground motion intensity measure which is based on the spectral acceleration and a parameter proxy of the spectral shape named Np. The motivation of using this new ground motion intensity measure is because recently it has demonstrated its potential in predicting the response of buildings subjected to earthquakes. In fact, it was demonstrated that intensity measures based on Np are more efficient compared with other parameter of the literature. It is important to mention that this is the first time that a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis is performed using this new intensity measurement. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a robust minutiae based method for fingerprint verification. The proposed method uses Delaunay Triangulation to represent minutiae as nodes of a connected graph composed of triangles. The minimum angle over all triangulations is maximized, which gives local stability to the constructed structures against rotation and translation variations. Geometric thresholds and minutiae data were used to characterize the triangulations created from input and template fingerprint images. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed through calculations of false acceptance rate (FAR), false rejected rate (FRR) and equal error rate (EER) over FVC2002 databases compared to the results of other approaches. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The main objective of this research is to investigate the feasibility of using the residual powder obtained from organic waste to replace a part of Portland cement during concrete production. The chemical and physical properties of the organic residual powder were first investigated using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The replacement ratios of cement have also been studied for 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% of the residual powder by weight. Moreover, we evaluated the compressive strength, specific gravity, water absorption, and voids content of the concrete specimens that were modified with different concentrations of the residual powder. Results indicate that 5% residual powder concentration resulted in better physical and mechanical properties of the modified concrete when compared with the reference concrete. At this concentration, the addition of residual powder act as fillers in concrete, reducing the amount of voids and causing a higher density in the material. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The problem of urban road accidents in Colombia is remarkable and has a significant magnitude. For this reason, a technical study of this important public health scourge is important. The quantitative techniques employed are usually highly aggregated and will not correctly identify the determinant variables of the problem. This paper examines the relationship between urban road accidents and variables related to road infrastructure, environment, traffic volumes and traffic control. Some accident-prone sections in the city of Cartagena (Colombia) are specifically identified by the empirical Bayesian method based on GIS. A total of 69 accident-prone sections were identified in the city. It was evident that the marginal effect on the accident rate for motorcycles is well above that for cars and buses. Empirical evidence also showed that the sections located in commercial areas tend to have higher frequency of accidents due to the high presence of pedestrians. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Due to opportunities for economic and social development in the biofuels market, improvement to the supply chain has become a relevant matter. In agro-industrial supply chains, procurement costs are highly relevant. Since sugarcane is a high performance raw material for ethanol production, this paper proposes a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Model for cost optimization for harvesting, loading and transportation operations. The model determines the quantity of machines and workers to meet the biofuel plant requirements. Costs of resources for harvesting and loading as well as transportation costs from the land parcel to the production plant are minimized. Also, the model calculates the cost of penalties for shortages (unmet demand) and the cost of equipment idle time. The implementation of the model in a Peruvian biofuels company, showed a cost reduction of around 11% when compared to the current costs. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The amounts of energy involved in the SPT test are evaluated by the EFV method. With force and acceleration records, amounts of energy, equipment efficiency, experimental dynamic reaction force of the soil and stresses acting on the sampler were assessed. In this study, a sample extractor system was designed, which consists of a base, a hydraulic cylinder and a load cell. The objective of this equipment is to experimentally quantify the internal friction force, allowing the stresses acting on the sampler to be evaluated. Also, the Aoki\u00b4s a parameter, which is the ratio of internal friction and external friction between the ground and the sampler, could be calculated. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Due to the heterogeneity of rocks, their tensile strength is around 10% of their compressive strength, which means that breakage is mainly caused by tensile stress. The measure of tensile stress is very difficult due to rock fragility, so it has usually been measured by indirect measurement methods, including the Brazilian test. However, recent works indicate that the tensile strength values obtained through the Brazilian test must be increased by almost 26%. To understand this divergence, indirect tensile tests have been monitored. The aim is to know the material deformation and load increase by means of stepwise regression. Stress fields in slightly deformed samples are analyzed and modeled (3D finite differences) with loads applied on flat and curved plates and different Young's modulus. Finally, the results are analyzed and compared with strength values reported using Timoshenko theory and Hondros' approximation. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

There are two types of models for consistency assessment: aggregated and disaggregated. The first one considers the difference between design and operating speed at the middle point of isolated horizontal curves. The second one considers the spatial variation of the operating speed profile along the horizontal curve. This paper compares the two types of consistency assessment models, using naturalistic speed and geometry data obtained in 34 horizontal curves of two-lane rural roads in Chile, using a 10 Hz GPS. Results obtained showed that in only 19 cases both methods are equivalent. This equivalence occurred only when operating speed profiles have the lowest spatial variance along the curves. If the operating speed profile has a high variance the consistency level obtained using both methods is different and the better option is combine it. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to compare the bioclimate and energy consumption of two coffee wet processing facilities in Colombia, with two typical types of Colombian coffee, using computer simulation. Specifically, we evaluated the effect of the heat generated by machines and the effect of the natural ventilation area on temperature and relative air humidity inside these buildings and their energy consumption. The postharvest plant with typology b gave the best results in terms of temperature and relative humidity suitable to preserve the quality of the coffee bean. Its approximate energy consumption was 30% of the total consumed by typology a. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Monte Carlo simulations combined with the Heisenberg model and Metropolis algorithm were used to study the equilibrium magnetic properties of magnetic multi-core nanoparticles of magnetite. Three effects were considered in this simulation: the Zeeman effect, magneto crystalline anisotropy, and dipolar interaction. Moreover, the influence of the size distribution (mean diameter and standard deviation) on the magnetization was analyzed. As an important result, a reduction of the equilibrium magnetization caused by the dipolar interaction and the magneto crystalline anisotropy was observed. On the other hand, the nanoparticle size increase produces an enhancement in the equilibrium magnetization, because of the lower influence of dipolar interaction. Cooling temperature effect was also observed, presenting a decrease in the equilibrium magnetization as the temperature was increased. The influence of the easy axis direction was studied. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The effect of crosswinds on the risk of railway vehicles overturning has been a major issue ever since manufacturers began to produce lighter vehicles that run at high speeds. However, ride comfort can also be influenced by crosswinds, and this effect has not been thoroughly analyzed. This article describes the effect of crosswinds on ride comfort in high speed trains when running on curves and for several wind velocities under a Chinese hat wind scenario, which is the scenario recommended by the standard. Simulation results show that the combination of crosswinds and the added stiffness of the lateral bumpstop on the secondary suspension can become a significant source of instability, leading to flange-to-flange contact and greatly jeopardizing ride comfort. Moreover, this comfort problem is an issue even when the wheel unloading ratio is well below the standard\u2019s limits and vehicle safety can be guaranteed. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Vanadium carbide (VC) coatings were deposited on AISI H13 and AISI D2 steel substrates via thermo-reactive deposition/diffusion (TRD) in order to evaluate their mechanical properties as a function of the vanadium content. The coatings were produced with different percentages of ferrovanadium in the reactive mixture. The chemical composition of the coatings was determined through X-ray fluorescence (XRF), the crystal structure was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), the morphology was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the hardness was measured with nanoindention, and the tribological behavior was studied using the ball-on-disc test. The XRF analysis indicated that the coatings grown on D2 steel decreased the atomic percentage of vanadium when the coating was made with 20% ferrovanadium. The XRD analysis established that the coatings were polycrystalline, with a cubic structure. The SEM images revealed that the coatings grown on D2 steel were more compact than those grown on H13 steel. Finally, the wear tests established that the friction coefficient decreased with an increase of vanadium in the coating. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The study evaluates five computational intelligence algorithms, namely: the Firefly Algorithm, the Differential Evolutionary Algorithm, the Simulated Annealing Algorithm and two versions of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. Each algorithm is assessed based on the performance provided by two different network topologies under different data traffic loads and with a different number of wavelengths available in the network. The impact of implementing wavelength conversion processes is also taken into account in this study. Simulated results show that, in general, the evaluated algorithms appropriately solve the problem in small-sized networks in which a similar performance was found. However, key differences were found when the size of the network is significant. This means that more suitable algorithms optimize the search space and the fall into local minimums is avoided. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Vast sections of the planet face either a dearth of ground-based weather stations or are hampered by the poor quality of those in service. In response, researchers are forced to turn to climate field databases, as they constitute a source of reliable information for local studies. Insofar as the Amazon region, these databases prove to be valuable given their open-access platform and the fact that this expansive region possesses few quality stations (coupled with insufficient temporal coverage). However, before basing research on such archives, this information should be compared against in situ station measurements. Then, the present study assesses the validity of temperature and precipitation information furnished by University of Delaware\u2019s database (UD-ATP) by means of a comparison with the open-access information available from Climate Explorer project (CLIMEXP). Results show that UD-ATP database offers better precipitation data representation, especially on Brazil, which is perhaps the effect of higher-quality and larger-quantity observed data. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The results show that 19.2% of the energy preheater exhaust gas can be recovered to be used in producing 5.5 GWh/year of electricity and 23.7 GWh/year of thermal energy in the cement plant. The electricity generated would represent annual savings of 1.18 $/t cement. The thermal energy produced in cogeneration, equivalent to coal in the plant itself, represents cement savings of 0.51 $/t cement and emissions reductions of 8 kt CO2/year. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "A huge landslide took place at Alto Verde residential complex at the end of 2008 in the city of Medellin, Colombia, claiming the lives of twelve people and destroying six houses. Landslides are characterized by large deformations in the soil mass. This study used the material point method (MPM), a particle-based method that takes advantage of a double Lagrangian-Eulerian discretization. This approach provides a robust framework that enables the numerical simulation of large strains, without mesh entanglement issues that are common with the Finite Element Method. The numerical model proposed here assumes simplifications of the geotechnical, morphological and structural buildings conditions on the site. Nevertheless, the final numerical deformed configuration described the geometric features observed in the field successfully. The result allows applications such as the design of barriers, risk assessment or determination of a minimum safe distance for a building from a slope susceptible to landslides. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Alginate is a linear polymer composed of \u03b2-1,4 linked mannuronic acid and its epimer, \u03b1-L-guluronic acid, and frequently extracted from marine algae, as from bacteria such as Azotobacter and Pseudomonas. Here, we show the impact of conventional and unconventional carbon sources on A. vinelandii growth, alginate production, its mean molecular weight (MMW) and its viscosifying power. Starting with 20 g/L of sugars, the highest biomass concentration was obtained using deproteinized and hydrolyzed whey (6.67\u00b10.72 g/L), and sugarcane juice (6.68\u00b10.45 g/L). However, the maximum alginate production was achieved using sucrose (5.11\u00b10.37 g/L), as well the highest alginate yield and specific productivity. Otherwise, the higher alginate MMW was obtained using sugarcane juice (1203\u00b1120 kDa), and the higher viscosifying power was obtained using deproteinized/ hydrolyzed whey (23.8\u00b12.6 cps L/galg). This information suggests that it is possible to manipulate the productivity and molecular characteristics of alginates, as a function of the carbon source used. All this, together with the knowledge of the effects of environmental conditions will allow for high yields of high added value biopolymers. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This research has the objective to provide a more reliable maintenance process through the implementation of the measurement and control of the operating parameters of the plant resulting in a better management by reducing the stops due unforeseen problems. Some results of the methodology application were shown like: annual maintenance cost reduction due corrective maintenance, increase of the mean time between failure (MTBF) and reduction of the mean time to repair (MTTR) in all applied areas.

    "Abstract": "The current pressure of global competition is demanding faster, reliable, flexible, and cheaper products. Thus, in order to keep up with customer demands, companies need to continuously improve their manufacturing systems and develop new strategies. Supply chain management (SCM) is currently the most important tactic for modern companies to maintain their competitiveness. Supplier selection process (SSP) plays an important role in SCM and has been studied extensively in the past years as a tool to provide guidance and help to researchers and decision makers. Green supply chain management (GSCM) arose due to the recent increase in environmental protection. Consequently, the correspondent green supplier selection process (GSSP) has become more and more critical in GSCM.

    "Abstract": "General properties of clays from Ceramica Murano Mine, in the municipality of El Zulia, Norte de Santander, have been investigated. Five clay samples were collected from different mantles of the mine. All the samples were characterized using chemical and mineralogical analysis, as well as physical properties like particle size, plasticity, drying and firing shrinkage and water absorption capacity. The chemical and mineralogical results indicated that all samples contained different amount of kaolinite and quartz, followed by hematite and anatase. Low amounts of muscovite were found mainly in samples F2 and F5. These clays are suitable for use as a raw material in creating ceramic construction products, especially for the manufacture of roof tiles and bricks according to the Winkler methodology. The variations found in the characterization of the raw material influence the technological properties of the ceramic that can be obtained from the clays under study. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper investigate the impact of Working Conditions on Quality of Working Life of human talent of manufacturing sector in the Colombian Caribbean region. To analyze this process interviewed 518 employees in the sector. The experimental design used was not descriptive cross type; each participant was applied an interview with the instrument of Working Conditions and Quality of Working Life Tool (Wage and Subjective Conditions). Data were analyzed using correlation analysis and logistic regression models. The results showed that the thermal environment and safety standard at work positively affects the Quality of Working Life. These results show that the relationship between working conditions and CVL is based on competition and far from linear or simple relationship relating to the consideration of the presence or absence of working conditions. This has implications when formulating policies, programs and interventions to prevent the negative effects of working conditions and enhance the industrial safety within industrial companies. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Street sweeping is an important service that is usually performed by lorry-type vehicles that have a gutter brush, which is comprised of clusters of steel bristles that sweep the debris found in the road gutter. Effective operation of this brush is important, as most of the debris on roads is located in the gutter. In order to model a gutter brush by means of finite element dynamic analyses, it is necessary to determine appropriate values of the Rayleigh damping coefficients of both individual bristles and clusters of bristles. This paper presents the methodology and results of experimental tests that have been conducted to determine these coefficients. The results obtained are useful when studying the performance of conventional and oscillatory street sweeper gutter brushes by means of dynamic finite element modeling. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Ternary mixtures of geopolymers obtained from the alkaline activation of metakaolin (MK), boiler slag (BS), and rice husk ash (RHA) using a solution of potassium hydroxide were mechanically, thermally, and microstructurally characterized. The geopolymer properties and final microstructures indicate that the addition of BS, despite containing large amounts of unburned material (16.36%), allows for greater densification and greater homogeneity of the geopolymeric gel, which results in greater stability in strength at long curing ages. Substitution of 30% of MK by BS results in an increase in compressive strength of up to 21% and 122% after 28 and 180 days of curing, respectively. These results demonstrate the possibility of the construction sector using geopolymers based on MK and adding BS and RHA to obtain cementitious materials with a lower environmental impact. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Professional profiles for building engineers and barriers they may encounter when accessing the labor market as well as in their career development in the sector are researched. Having identified some variables as relevant barriers, this empirical research is exploratory in nature and adopts a descriptive and inferential approach, in order to analyze the influence of gender in the perception of barriers in two Spanish universities.

    "Abstract": "This experimental work is aimed at the influence of seawater immersion in low impact energy behavior of a novel Colombian fique fiber reinforced bio-resin laminate. Such material was manufactured by vacuum infusion. The specimens were immersed in seawater during a bioactivity period of six months. Low energy impact tests were performed in order to obtain the penetration and perforation threshold according to energy profiles. The damage extent was characterized by means of Ultrasonics. Tensile stress tests were also performed and the breaking surfaces were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy. The results revealed that the new biocomposite, after seawater immersion, has higher penetration and perforation thresholds than the biocomposite without immersion. Tensile test results show stiffness lost and increase of elongation at break. This behavior of the immersed biocomposite is due to a plasticization process of the material. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

In the construction sector, there is a broad range of techniques for the exploitation of different types of waste, which can then be used as a replacement for raw materials. This paper presents the results of a study of vinasse, a by-product of biomass ethanol, andanalyzes its viability as a bitumen modifier in asphalt mixes. For this purpose, four AC-16S asphalt mixes were evaluated for moisture sensitivity, plastic deformation, stiffness, and fatigue. The mix formulas were the following: (Mix 1) 50/70 bitumen; (Mix 2) 50/70 bitumen modified with 10% vinasse; (Mix 3) rubber bitumen; (Mix 4) rubber bitumen modified with 10% vinasse. The results of this study showed that bitumen modified with vinasse improved the mechanical performance of the AC-16S mix and also contributed to the valorization of vinasse waste. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Nowadays, knowledge is a powerful tool in order to obtain benefits within organizations. This is especially true when semantic web technologies are being adapted for the requirements of enterprises. In this regard, the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is an area of work developing specifications and standards to support the use of knowledge organization systems. Over recent years, SKOS has become one of the sweet spots in the linked data (LD) ecosystems. In this paper, we propose a linked data-based approach using SKOS, in order to manage the knowledge from supply chains. Additionally, this paper covers how SKOS can be enriched by ontologies and LD to further improve semantic information management. This is due to the fact that the supply chain literature focuses on assets, data, and information elements of exchange between supply chain partners, despite improved integration and collaboration requiring the development of more complex features of know-how and knowledge. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The model is function of mechanical and physical variables that depend not only on the vehicle but also on the ground. This toolbox can be extended to GPS tracking files by means of reading data file plug-ins. Even standard drive cycles can be simulated. Battery and hydrogen consumption, hydrogen storage tank level, battery state of charge, power consumption and fuel cell energy production, maximum range and maximum number of cycles for a real route can be determined. The model facilitates the prediction of the vehicle range and the hydrogen and energy consumption. Real route simulation gives a good approximation of the vehicle speed close to real-life services instead of using driving cycles that are quite arbitrary approximations to a real route. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The most important results presented herein are the change on lateral stiffness and resistance capacity of the load-bearing wall supported on a slab versus the wall supported on a fixed base. Analytical finite element slab-wall models were built using ANSYS. During the experimental test process of horizontal loading, we detected that the stiffness of the slab-wall system decreased by a third compared to the one on the fixed base wall; a result that supported by the numerical models. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The occurrence of impact events (e.g. blackouts with vast geographic coverage) into electrical critic infrastructure systems usually require the analysis of cascade failure root causes through the conduction of structural vulnerability studies, with well-defined methodologies that may guide decision-making for the implementation of prevention actions and for operation recovery of the power system (e.g. N-1 and Nt contingency studies). This technical contribution provides some alternative techniques based upon complex networks and graph theory, which in the last few years, have been proposed as useful methodologies for analysis of physical behavior of electric power systems. Vulnerability assessment is achieved by testing their performance into random risks and deliberate attack threat scenarios. Results shown in this proposal lead to conclusions on the use of complex networks for contingency analysis by means of studies of those events that result in cascade failures and consumer disconnections. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in developing biofuels from biomass by thermochemical processes like fast pyrolysis as a promising alternative to supply ever-growing energy consumption. However, the fast pyrolysis process is complex, involving changes in phase, mass, energy, and momentum transport phenomena which are all strongly coupled with the reaction rate. Despite many studies in the area, there is no agreement in the literature regarding the reaction mechanisms. Furthermore, no detailed universally applicable phenomenological models have been proposed to describe the main physical and chemical processes occurring within a particle of biomass. This has led to difficulties in reactor design and pilot industrial scale operation, stunting the popularization of the technology. This paper reviews relevant topics to help researchers gain a better understanding of how to address the modeling of biomass pyrolysis. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper shows the behavior of a three-phase power converter with resistive load using a quasi-sliding and a chaos control techniques for output voltage regulation. Controller is designed using Zero Average Dynamic (ZAD) and Fixed Point Inducting Control (FPIC) techniques. Designs have been tested in a Rapid Control Prototyping (RCP) system based on Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for dSPACE platform. Bifurcation diagrams show the robustness of the system. Chaos detection is a signal processing method in the time domain, and has power quality phenomena detection applications. Results show that the phase voltage in the load has sinusoidal performance when it is controlled with these techniques. When delay effects are considered, experimental and numerical results match in both of stable and transition to chaos zones. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "A variety of models for the prediction of effort costs in software projects have been developed, including some that are specific for Web applications. In this research we tried to determine if the use of specific models is justified by comparing the cost behavior of Web and no- Web projects. We focused on two aspects of the cost calculation: the diseconomies of scale in software development and the impact of some project features that are used as cost drivers. We hypothesized that for these kinds of projects, diseconomies of scale are higher but the cost-increasing effect of the cost drivers is mitigated. We tested such hypotheses using a set of real projects. Our results suggest that both hypotheses hold. Thus, the present research\u2019s main contribution to the literature is that the development of specific models for the estimation of effort costs for the case of Web developments is justified. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The solubility of CO2 in Colombian heavy oil was calculated using the Peng-Robinson cubic equation of state and the Lee-Kesler correlations. The crude was represented as a mixture of pseudo-components and for each one of them, the thermodynamic and critical properties were estimated. The results obtained in representing the oil with four, five and six pseudo-components show that all these representations produce similar results and therefore the use of four pseudo-components is sufficient and has a lower computational cost. Excellent results were obtained by comparing the experimental and calculated data. For this system, it is enough to have a complete characterization of the SARA analysis and to use four pseudo-components to adequately model the vapor-liquid equilibrium of CO2 -heavy oil. \u00a9 The author.",

The chemical elemental analysis was performed using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), the morphology of the coatings was determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Measures of friction coefficient and wear rate were obtained by ball on disc test. EEA analyses allowed to establish that the first 10 nm of the coatings are comprised probably of Bi4Ti3O12 and Ti2O3, AFM measurements indicate that the coatings have an average roughness of 22.28nm and grain size of 50nm. Finally, the tribological tests established that the coefficient of friction and wear rate of the coated steel has similar values to the bare steel. \u00a9 The author.",

    "Abstract": "The majority of pressure filtration methods for coffee preparation constitute acceptable alternatives for the obtention of coffee with bitter notes and body. In this study, antioxidant metabolite retention, antioxidant activity, and cup profiles were determined for coffee beverages prepared using five methods of pressure filtration. The methods which registered the highest antioxidant retention rates were Espresso, Moka, and Staresso. The highest hydroxycinnamic acid content was obtained with the Staresso, Espresso, and Moka methods, in descending order. Antioxidant capacity was proportional to antioxidant compound retention, with the ORAC method, in the beverages prepared, but not with the ABTS methodology. The Presso method had the lowest antioxidant retention rate. The beverage prepared with the Aeropress method obtained the lowest amount of antioxidant metabolites. In the five preparations evaluated, the most prominent hydroxycinnamic acid was chlorogenic acid. It is recommended that coffee prepared with the Espresso or Moka methods be consumed. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This paper describes its manufacture in a succinct manner, and a thermal and energy comparison between the factory refrigerator and the refrigerator with the composite installed. Based on the experiments, it is concluded that when using the composite, the average internal temperature of the fridge is increased by 1\u00b0C, for practical and design purposes, the refrigerator still functions below 3\u00b0C. It was also found that at stable operating conditions the energy consumption using the composite saves approximately 1.5%. Despite these slight savings, the pyro-expanded perlite composite acts as a thermal isolating material. This material may exhibit better ease of use and thermal, energetic and economic benefits, without omitting the environmental characteristics that they favor. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, a study of the propagation of partial discharge pulses in the stator winding of a synchronous machine is presented. This study was performed by injecting artificial partial discharge pulses in the stator winding of a 2.4 kV/210 kVA salient-pole synchronous machine. It was found that the propagation of the partial-discharge PD signals is presented in two modes: the slow mode, in which the coil acts as a transmission line; and the fast mode, in which the pulse propagates through the overhangs. The fast mode is due to capacitive and inductive couplings in the overhangs. In the slow mode, a PD signal manifests itself at the generator terminals after a transit time that depends on the distance traveled by the pulse. A strong positive linear correlation was observed between the arrival time in the slow mode and the length traveled by the pulse in this mode. The DC ohmic resistance between the injection point and the measurement point was used to represent the distance traveled by the pulse in the slow mode. The capacitive and inductive couplings also cause a crosstalk between the phases. As a consequence, a PD signal can be measured at different phases to the origin phase. In the slow mode, the signal will suffer attenuation in amplitude due to the dispersion and the absorption of energy while it propagates in the slow mode. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper states an approach for the operationalization of a solution architecture model, as an integral part of the development process and the applications maintenance. The proposed approach has been put into practice in a Company from the financial sector. The process of construction and implementation process of technological solution in an Enterprise takes multiple practices and management models, and it brings into play different roles and actors during its execution, from the business and technological perspective. Recently, the concept of solution architecture, has emerged as a better practice (little explored and documented) and it is being used in the execution of initiatives related with the development of technology solutions cycle, also it interacts collaboratively with other better management practices as software and enterprise architecture. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we investigated if the driver\u2019s ability to take over vehicle control when being engaged in a secondary task (Surrogate Reference Task) can be predicted by a subject\u2019s multitasking ability and reaction time. 23 participants performed a multitasking test and a simple response task and then drove for about 38 min highly automated on a highway and encountered five take-over situations. Data analysis revealed significant correlations between the multitasking performance and take-over time as well as gaze distributions for Situations 1 and 2, even when reaction time was controlled. This correlation diminished beginning with Situation 3, but a stable difference between the worst multitaskers and the best multitaskers persisted. Reaction time was not a significant predictor in any situation. The results can be seen as evidence for stable individual differences in dual task situations regarding automated driving, but they also highlight effects associated with the experience of a take-over situation. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The UASB (Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket) reactors efficiency of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWPT) was evaluated over a period of 9 years. The WWTP treated an average flow of 500 l/s, with removal efficiencies of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and suspended solids (SS) of 66 %, 52 %, and 60 %, respectively. The biogas production reached 37541 m3/month (82.4 % of methane), with a sludge production of 334 m3/month. The hydraulic retention time was among 7 and 8 hours, typical interval of UASB systems for a temperature of 26 \u00b0C. Removal of nitrogen and phosphorous was not found. The efficiencies, and similar results in Indonesia and Latin America, served to conclude that anaerobic digestion was a promising process for the pretreatment of wastewater in tropical countries. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Varying the operational parameters levels (rotor velocity, hammer row number and crusher capacity) were carried up two experimental series: First series was aimed to obtain the influence of the operational parameters on the power consumed by the crusher motor; the second series evaluated the crusher specific energy consumption behavior. First series empirical model obtained describes the influence of operational parameters on power consumption. Also the relationship among specific energy consumption and crusher speed and capacity were obtained. The most efficient operational regimen corresponded to 1100 rpm of the rotor velocity, 2 hammer row numbers and 15 t/h of crusher capacity. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents the study of the ground plane effect in passband filters using metamaterial cells in Open Split Ring Resonators (OSRR) structures on microstrip substrates. Three different configurations have been proposed, namely: by removing partially the ground plane of the OSRR cell back end, by windows design over the ground plane at the back end of each cell and by placing a full ground plane. The conducted analysis shows that the filter transmission response featuring a ground plane including windows proved to be the most flattened with the middle bandwidth of the three configurations. On the other hand, the performance of these filters is similar to a conventional filter based on three-pole microstrip technology but with a considerable reduction in size of about 60%. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Specifically, we have adapted some of the characteristics of the agile methodologies, which have allowed us to produce useful prototypes that are focused on the users while receiving constant feedback from them. The main goal of the proposed methodology is to identify usability problems and UX factors in the early stages of educational software development. Furthermore, we have also applied and validated the proposal during the framework development of an educational software project for users with special educational needs. A specific case taking into account key usability issues to support students with special education needs (SEN) is presented. In conclusion, we state that the proposed methodology could be a good design process philosophy to follow in the development of software projects in general, and in educational projects in particular. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Variation of the internal friction angle and cohesion, as a function of the specific weight, depth and decomposition time of the landfill was evaluated. Results were also compared to international values used for design purposes. Results showed a remarkable influence of the waste decomposition time in the shear strength.

The carbide coating treatment was performed using molten borax with added ferroniobium, ferrovanadium, and aluminum at temperatures of 1223, 1293, and 1363 K for 2, 3, 4, and 5 h. The coating layers were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The growth rates of the coatings were studied, and a kinetic model of the layer thickness was constructed as a function of the time and temperature treatment. The hardness and friction coefficient (COF) of the coatings was measured through nanoindentation and pin on disk test respectively. The carbide layers had a homogeneous thickness and a hardness of 37.63 GPa, which is close to values obtained in superhard materials, and the COF was in the range of 0,3 for the coated steels. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The best formulation was obtained by multiple optimization: DSG (20.9%), DSFA (28.9%) and lime color (0.029%), and its properties were: Xw (78.3%), pH (5.1), acidity (0.4%), PI (0.787 meq H2O2/kg), \u03b7 (2952.2 cP), \u03b6 (27.0 mV) and color (L*: 51.0, a*:-5.8, b*: 31.2). The AP is a raw material with industrial potential, which facilitates the production system of guacamole and its control. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Time and cost overruns in highway construction are usual in Colombia. Contractors regularly fail in cost estimation and construction scheduling. An analysis of important factors on time and cost overruns in highway construction in southwest Colombia is presented in this paper. Forty highway construction projects were reviewed. Data from construction documents were collected to prepare a data base for probabilistic analysis. Data collected include scheduled construction time and cost, actual construction time and cost, and unexpected events which could have affected the construction process. Data were used in a probabilistic cost and schedule risk analysis to identify critical factors in construction time and cost overruns in the region. It was found that the activities that most affect the time and cost overruns are the construction of the granular base and the asphalt layer. The most common causes of construction overruns were found to be poor cost and duration estimates, rain, and materials supply problems. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Every day the number of diseases related to brain problems increases dramatically. Medical facilities are full of people who need complex rehabilitation processes as a result of suffering from Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, brain stroke, or multiple sclerosis, as well as other conditions. Patients often spend a long time travelling every day to get to the corresponding rehabilitation clinics. Physiotherapists carefully attend patients over a period of time, and the exercises are often extremely repetitive. The type of patient suffering from these type of illnesses is unable to perform many common every day actions such as getting-up from a chair, walking in a straight line, picking up objects, etc. The system we propose in this paper provides a way for patients to perform the common rehabilitation process of getting up from a chair. It monitors and guides the patient when the specialist considers they are prepared to do so. The specialists can focus on the results and the way to improve each rehabilitation process and not just on iterations. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

By doing this the requirements description, analysis and comprehension is facilitated for both developers and end users. As a research methodology, we decided to use a systematic mapping study covering the last fourteen years (2000 - 2014). As far as we know, such studies have not yet been done; however, the cost incurred from errors in the requirements elicitation phase is one of the problems that is most commonly reported by the practitioners.

Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus tend to be limiting resources in standing water bodies, so increased concentrations tend to result in increased plant growth, followed by corollary increases in subsequent trophic levels. Consequently, a body of water's trophic index may sometimes be used to make a rough estimate of its biological condition.

This problem, also known as \u201cthe terrorist threat problem\u201d, is formulated in a bi-level programming structure and solved by means of a genetic algorithm. The solution identifies the most vulnerable links of the network in terms of a terrorist attack, providing signals for future reinforcement of the network or more strict surveillance of critical elements. The proposed approach has been tested on three case studies: a didactic five-bus power system, a prototype of the Colombian power system and the IEEE Reliability Test System.

Tensor theory is based on the dyadic product between voltage and current instantaneous vectors; this definition allows us to represent the phenomena of power quality produced by loads operation, through the deformation of a cube and the trajectory of one of its three-dimensional vectors. This new way of characterization could help researchers to construct better models of three-phase loads, or to achieve a better monitoring and machines diagnosis.

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a new method for the characterization and diagnosis of electrical disturbances caused by fuses operation in the electrical distribution systems. A set of descriptors is proposed in order to quantify the typical features of the distortions caused by operation of expulsion and current limiting fuses. A multivariate statistical analysis is performed to select the descriptors with the best profiles qualifiers and the optimal decision thresholds are selected to classify the disturbances using machine learning algorithms. Voltage and current signals of the fuses operation are obtained from the ATP-EMTP simulation, as well as some real signals, to be all used in the validation of the new proposed algorithm, obtaining optimal performance and efficiency results. The algorithm was implemented in Matlab and the computational requirements are minimal. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "A model to improve the estimation of the power and energy from photovoltaic installations under dynamic shading conditions is proposed in this paper. The model considers the shaded profile in each photovoltaic module and the temperature profile to update the model parameters of each photovoltaic module. The impact of dynamic shades on the power production is analyzed, illustrating the large errors introduced by classical prediction approaches, which consider non-shading at all or average shading. Moreover, a procedure to model the shades profile in any environment is described and illustrated. Finally, experimental irradiance and environment temperature profiles are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in contrast with the classical approaches. The results illustrate that the classical approaches overestimate the power produced by the photovoltaic array, in contrast with the power produced by the proposed model. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This security scheme is represented by an up and down spinning reserve, which allows to drive the system frequency to a steady state after the occurrence of events associated not only to forecast errors in the electricity demand (as traditional schemes do), but also to forecast errors in the power availability of the intermittent energy sources. The proposed methodology was implemented on a real microgrid that considers the interconnection of a photovoltaic generator. From this, it was concluded that the security scheme designed for the microgrid efficiently ensured the relation between generation and demand, at each study hour. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Conductor overheating and cable insulation accelerated aging can be caused by temporary increases in the RMS values of the voltages and currents due to stationary disturbances. Waveform distortion, unbalance and phase displacements can be considered among the stationary disturbances. For disturbances with short duration, there are no significant reductions in the insulation lifetime, but disturbances acting for long time periods will cause cumulative and detrimental effects. Currently valid models for insulation aging are employed; the expected power quality disturbance levels are extracted from power quality databases.

    "Abstract": "Although Fault Detection and Isolation systems have been widely studied in recent years, it is still a very active research field due to its relevance in industrial production systems. In this paper, a new approach for multiple fault detection by using residual evaluation is proposed. First, an analytical redundancy scheme for residual generation is applied using nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs for normal and faulty conditions. Simultaneous fault data is included in the training set in order to ensure multiple fault detection. Then, an adaptive filter considering statistic measures from input is used to increase sensibility and robustness. Filter coefficients are obtained off-line through genetic algorithm optimization. Finally, a neural network classifier is used for fault isolation. The proposed algorithm is tested on a rotary mechatronic test bench for backlash, bearing static friction and transmission faults to show the effectiveness of the proposed detection. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) is a device that can compensate voltage sags by injecting reactive power into distribution systems. This paper shows the influence on voltage sags characteristics by the presence of twelve-pulse DSTATCOM in the modified IEEE-13 distribution system. The analysis is performed by means of a random generation of disturbances using a MATLAB routine to identify the critical buses of the test system. Further, the DSTATCOM model taking advantage of the available elements from ATP/EMTP software is described. Simulations show that when DSTATCOM is placed directly to an affected bus it is possible to obtain a complete mitigation of the voltage sag. Finally, the relation between the reactive power injected by DSTATCOM, the type of voltage sag and the location of the affected bus is considered. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Descendant Clock Auctions have been increasingly used in power markets. Traditional approaches are focused on discovering the bidders\u2019 best response but neglecting the bidders\u2019 adaptation. This paper presents an algorithm based on decision theory to estimate the bidders\u2019 behavior throughout the auction. The proposed model uses portfolio concepts and historical data of spot markets to estimate a long-term contract supply curve. This model was applied to evaluate the Colombia\u2019s Organized Market (MOR). Demand curve parameters and round size were varied to evaluate their impact over auction outputs. Results show that the demand curve has a quite small impact over bidders\u2019 decisions and round size management is useful to avoid non-competitive bidders\u2019 behavior. In addition, it is shown that auction\u2019s starting prices strongly influence auction\u2019s clearing prices.

    "Abstract": "Distributed generation (DG) is an important issue for distribution networks due to the improvement in power losses, but the location and size of generators could be a difficult task for exact techniques. The metaheuristic techniques have become a better option to determine good solutions and in this paper the application of a bat-inspired algorithm (BA) to a problem of location and size of distributed generation in radial distribution systems is presented. A comparison between particle swarm optimization (PSO) and BA was made in the 33-node and 69-node test feeders, using as scenarios the change in active and reactive power, and the number of generators. PSO and BA found good results for small number and capacities of generators, but BA obtained better results for difficult problems and converged faster for all scenarios. The maximum active power injections to reduce power losses in the distribution networks were found for the five scenarios. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The methodology analyzes the current harmonics emission risk at the PCC due to the connection of disturbing loads.

From the simulation results, potential risk factors for critical harmonics indicators are identified, leading to a classification of the scenarios into groups of exposed or unexposed to risk factors. Finally, the incidence rate of harmonics is calculated for each load connection scenario and the risk of critical harmonics scenarios due to the exposure to risk factors is estimated. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The optimization of the parameters of total extraction of carotenoids from the dried peel was carried out using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and the Central Composite Design (CCD). The extraction parameters were temperature, extraction time and solid-solvent ratio. The optimal conditions for UAA-assisted extraction were: 48 \u00b0 C, extraction time of 28 min, and solid-solvent ratio of 0.0037 g / mL, with a predicted carotenoid content of 151.50 mg / 100 g of dry peel. To validate the optimized model, the experimental values were compared with the predicted values to verify the adequacy and fit of the model. The ultrasound extraction was 33.60% higher than the maceration technique, reason why this study indicated that the UAE represents an ecological contribution in the valorization of byproducts coming from peach palm fruits. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The method used was the psychometric paradigm and, under its assumptions we have studied nine factors or qualitative attributes of risk. The main statistical analysis was carried out using a classification tree. As a result is obtained that four of the nine attributes studied predict significantly the perceived risk of the sample. The attribute on the delay of the consequences has been the most important predictor in the model, followed by the attribute that explores the potential catastrophic risk and the attribute that explores the serious consequences. Finally the attribute related to the personal vulnerability has emerged. The implications of the results are exposed. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Different harmonic studies analyze their impact on the grids based on different types of harmonic models. The most used model is the constant current source. Measurements have shown that the harmonic currents emitted by electronic devices depend on the circuit topology and the existing supply voltage distortion. This paper quantifies the impact of supply voltage distortion on the harmonic current emission of individual devices and the summation of multiple devices. After a classification of the commonly used circuit topologies, a time-domain model is developed for each of them. Then the individual and combined impact of voltage harmonics on the harmonic current emission of the modeled devices is analyzed based on simulations. Finally the impact of voltage distortion on the summation of multiple devices is analyzed and the accuracy of constant current source models is evaluated. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

A possibilistic harmonic load-flow methodology, previously developed by the authors, allows for uncertainties related to linear and nonlinear load variations to be modeled. Moreover, it is well known that some types of wind turbines also produce harmonics, in fact, timevarying harmonics. The purpose of this paper is to present an improvement of the former method, in order to include the uncertainties due to the wind speed variations as an input related with power generated by the turbines. Simulations to test the proposal are performed in the IEEE 14-bus standard test system for harmonic analysis, connecting to the network a wind farm composed by ten Full Power Converter (FPC) type wind turbines. Results obtained show that uncertainty in the wind speed has a considerable effect on the uncertainties associated with the computed harmonic voltage magnitudes. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Most of the soils of tropical countries, especially those in South America and Africa, are affected by erosion processes. As a result, researchers in the field of geotechnical engineering, specifically in the context of \"biotechnology\" or \"bioengineering\", have been investigating the use of microorganisms to improve the geotechnical properties and stability of soils. Using this approach, this work was developed to analyze the effects of the implementation of a calcium carbonate precipitating nutrient in native microbiota on the mitigation of erosion processes in a tropical soil profile. The methodology used in this research consisted of collecting undisturbed samples in a soil profile located in an area affected by erosion processes. In such samples, the native bacteria were identified, and it was determined that the nutrient B4 induced the precipitation of calcium carbonate. Subsequently, soil samples were characterized physically, chemically, mineralogically and mechanically in their natural state and after the addition of the nutrient. The tests were performed at least fifteen days after treatment with the nutrient. It was concluded that the use of the nutrient B4 enabled the native bacteria present in the soil to precipitate calcium carbonate, resulting in improvements in the physical, chemical, mineralogical and mechanical properties of the soil, which allowed for the mitigation of erosion processes that characterize the soil profile studied. The conclusions derived from the study apply not only to other tropical soil profiles subjected to erosion but also to improvements of the geotechnical behavior of soils in general. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Power quality can be evaluated automatically using the characterizing and extracting information from voltage records.

    "Abstract": "Vega et al. [1] analyzed the influence of the attributes\u2019 dependence when ranking a set of alternatives in a multicriteria decision making problem with TOPSIS. They also proposed the use of the Mahalanobis distance to incorporate the correlations among the attributes in TOPSIS. Even in those situations for which dependence among attributes is very slight, the results obtained for the Mahalanobis distance are significantly different from those obtained with the Euclidean distance, traditionally used in TOPSIS, and also from results obtained using any other distance of the Minkowsky family. This raises serious doubts regarding the selection of the distance that should be employed in each case. To deal with the problem of the attributes\u2019 dependence and the question of the selection of the most appropriate distance measure, this paper proposes to use a new method for synthesizing the distances to the ideal and the anti-ideal in TOPSIS. The new procedure is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process and is able to capture the relative importance of both distances in the context given by the measure that is considered; it also provides rankings, which are closer to the distances employed in TOPSIS, regardless of the dependence among the attributes. The new technique has been applied to the illustrative example employed in Vega et al. [1]. \u00a9 The author.",

    "Abstract": "This paper addresses the short-term generation planning (STGP) through thermoelectric units. The mathematical model is presented as a Mixed Integer Non Linear Problem (MINLP). Several works on the state of art of the problem have revealed that the computational effort of this problem grows exponentially with the number of time periods and number of thermoelectric units. Therefore, we present two alternatives to solve a STGP based on Benders\u2019 partitioning algorithm and Lagrangian relaxation in order to reduce the computational effort. The proposal is to apply primal and dual decomposition techniques, which exploit the structure of the problem to reduce solution time by decomposing the STGP into a master problem and a subproblem. For Benders\u2019 algorithm, the master problem is a Mixed Integer Problem (MIP) and for the subproblem, it is a Non Linear Problem (NLP). For Lagrangian relaxation, the master problem and the subproblem are MINLP. The computational experiments show the performance of both decomposition techniques applied to the STGP. These techniques allow us to save computation time when compared to some high performance commercial solvers. \u00a9 The author.",

We used the methodology of least partial squares with the WarpPLS 4.0 software to develop a model of structural equations that explains such effects. The results show that when there is a high level of managerial commitment, this impacts the profits and competitiveness of companies positively.

Select the extractive method is one of the problems of Discrete Multicriteria Decision (MCDM) where decision-makers had problems in assigning weight to each criterion. To solve this problem, this article suggests the ENTROPY method.

Data were acquired with tide gauge pressure sensors, and calculated from a long time series of 798 days of data-logging, using the least-squares harmonic estimation method. The results show an improvement over previous results in the region. Seventy tidal constituents were obtained, of which 19 were the most representative with amplitudes greater than 1 cm and a contribution of 93% of the wave energy. In both stations, it was confirmed that the tides are mixed, with a semi-diurnal behavior. The tidal gauge benchmarks (TGBMs) were linked to vertical and horizontal Antarctic Geodetic Networks, which provides a very important contribution for geodetic, oceanographic and hydrographic studies in the area. \u00a9 The author.",

The stochastic frontier allows us to evaluate the technical efficiency of an energy producer according of the level of inputs.

At the moment, in Mexico, technical efficiency of thermal power units has not been studied for the national electricity system.

    "Abstract": "Design and ecology are critical issues in the industrial sector. Products are subject to constant review and optimization for survival in the market, and limited by their impact on the planet. Decisions about a new product affect its life cycle, consumers, and especially the environment. In order to achieve quality solutions, eco-effectiveness must be considered, therefore, in the design of a process, its product development and associated system. An orderly methodology is essential to help towards creating products that meet both user needs and current environmental requirements, under paradigms that create environmental value. To date, the industry has developed techniques in an attempt to address these expectations under Cradle-to-Cradle (C2C), which is loosely structured around the conceptual frameworks and design techniques. The present work describes a new framework that encompasses all stages of design, and enables interaction under a set of principles developed for C2C. Under this innovative new paradigm emerges the Genomic Model of Eco-innovation and Eco-design, proposed as a methodology for designing products that meet individual and collective needs, and which enables the design of eco-friendly products, by integrating them into the framework of the ISO standards of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), eco-design, eco-labeling, and C2C certification. \u00a9 The author.",

    "Abstract": "In Weibull accelerated life test analysis (ALT) with two or more variables (X<inf>2</inf>,X<inf>3</inf>,\u2026..X<inf>k</inf>)we estimated, in joint form, the parameters of the life stress model r{X(t)} and one shape parameter \u03b2. These were then used to extrapolate the conclusions to the operational level. However, these conclusions are biased because in the experiment design (DOE) used, each combination of the variables presents its own Weibull family (\u03b2<inf>i</inf> \u03b7<inf>i</inf>). Thus the estimated \u03b2 is not representative. On the other hand, since \u03b2 is determined by the variance of the logarithm of the lifetime data \u03c32<inf>t</inf>, the response variance \u03c32<inf>y</inf> and the correlation coefficient R2, which increases when variables are added to the analysis, \u03b2 is always overestimated. In this paper, the problem is statistically addressed and based on the Weibull families (\u03b2<inf>i</inf> \u03b7<inf>i</inf>) a vector Y<inf>\u03b7</inf> is estimated and used to determine the parameters of r{X(t)}. Finally, based on the variance \u03c32<inf>ti</inf> of each level, the variance of the operational level \u03c32<inf>op</inf> is estimated and used to determine the operational shape parameter \u03b2<inf>op</inf>.

The first method of sampling the pH grid consisted in the collection of soil samples by the traditional method (1 point / ha). The second method of pH determination was by on-the-go soil sensor (200 points / ha). The spherical model was better suited to most semivariograms, regardless of the sampling method. After adjusting the semivariograms for soil pH determination methods, thematic maps were made using normal kriging. The best spatial distribution of pH was obtained where the attribute was sampled by the on-the-go sensor. The number of pH samples collected and the sampling method influenced the visual representation of pH variability. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

For that reason, it is essential to optimize the costs of distribution. A steel producer located in Monterrey distributes their products to different parts of Mexico. Currently, the distribution is carried out through empirical knowledge, underusing resources and generating unnecessary costs. The aim is to undertake the distribution process more efficiently. This paper presents an optimization model based on vehicle routing problem (VRP), for the distribution of heavy pipes taking into account the company\u2019s own characteristics, such as: rented heterogeneous fleet, multiple shipments of products, split deliveries and open cycles (meaning that the routes may not necessarily end in the depot). \u00a9 The author.",

    "Abstract": "Historically, the design and fitting of prostheses had to rely on a slow process of trial and error, depending on the expertise of the prosthetist. Therefore, a clear definition of the concept of comfort and clear knowledge of its contributing factors are important when designing comfortable prostheses. However, there are currently no standardized methods to adequately measure prosthesis-related comfort. The aim of this study is to identify the factors that underlie the concept of comfort with prosthesis use in transfemoral amputees. Forty-one transfemoral amputees completed a questionnaire to evaluate the perception of comfort and to analyze the influence of six factors. It found a significant model that correctly classifies 84.9% of the cases. It can predict whether the patient feels comfort while using the prosthesis. Although all of the factors were significant, the factors with the greatest influence on the perception of comfort were functionality and pain. \u00a9 The author.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this work was to study the behavior of sugarcane bagasse submitted to cutting, as a function of its moisture content, angle of the blade edge and cutting speed. The specific cutting energy and peak cutting force were measured using an experimental facility developed for this series of experiments. An analysis of the results of the full factorial experimental design using a statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. The response surfaces and empirical models for the specific cutting energy and peak cutting force were obtained using statistical analysis system software. Low angle of the blade edge and low moisture content are, in this order, the most important experimental factors in determining a low specific cutting energy and a low peak cutting force respectively. The best cutting conditions are achieved for an angle of blade edge of 20.8\u00b0 and a moisture content of 10% w. b. The results of this work could contribute to the optimal design of sugarcane bagasse pre-treatment systems. \u00a9 The author.",

    "Abstract": "Foreign trade barriers and duties have been significantly reduced by multilateral agreements and integration mechanisms among nations. Logistics costs represent a significant proportion of the final price of the items, especially of the commodities. For this reason, minimizing logistics costs is an important challenge for nations in order to enhance competiveness of foreign trade and in particular to take advantage of natural resources rents. In this article, we propose a holistic framework for estimating logistics costs, focused on determining over costs that result from inefficient procedures and a lack of adequate public policies and regulations of the public entities. These issues have not been considered in the literature, and this article fills this gap. As a case study, we present the application of the framework to estimate over costs in some natural resources logistics chains of Bolivia. A discussion of the results found is presented together with recommendations for further research. \u00a9 The author.",

    "Abstract": "The present study shows the economic savings and environmental advantages of LED lighting technology for industrial applications. For this purpose a case study in which metal halide lights were replaced with LED lights has been performed. For validating the replacement of 400W metal halide by 200W LED luminaires, there have been performed lighting simulations and field measurements by lux meter. The results indicate that both luminaires are comparable, obtaining significant energy savings close to 50%. This research demonstrates that LED lighting technology offers high performance lighting solutions that optimize energy saving, while reducing maintenance costs, with a significantly lower total cost of ownership (TCO), increasing the life span of the luminaires. From the environmental point of view it means a significant reduction in CO2 emissions and the disposal of toxic waste such as mercury. \u00a9 The author.",

    "Abstract": "Mexico is the world\u2019s third largest consumer of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), only preceded by the United States and China. PET is commonly used in plastic containers such as beverage bottles and food packaging. It can be argued that the main problem regarding pollution generated by PET waste lies in the lack of appropriate solid waste management. The decision regarding facility location is the central issue in solid waste management. A mixed integer linear programming model of the capacitated facility location problem is proposed and then a genetic algorithm is designed to optimize the model. The problem is described as follows: given the quantities of PET generated in the northern region of Veracruz, Mexico, by considering five cities and each as a single generation source, a collection center has to be selected among a set of pre-identified locations in the town of Tempoal, Veracruz; in order to serve a set of demand points in the re-use market; demands are assumed to be uncertain. The aim is to minimize the system\u2019s overall cost. \u00a9 The author.",

    "Abstract": "The effect of gelatin, glycerol, and cellulose nanofiber (CNFs) concentrations on the mechanical properties, water vapor permeability, and color parameters of films was evaluated. The results indicate that the color is only affected by the gelatin concentration. Mechanical tests indicated that with increasing concentration of gelatin and CNFs, there is an increase in tensile strength, whereas an increase in glycerol concentration causes an increase in elongation, making the films more flexible. An increased concentration of gelatin and glycerol makes the film more permeable to water vapor, while an increase in the concentration of CNFs reduces this property. Finally, the addition of CNFs to gelatin-based films improves their mechanical and barrier properties (water vapor) without affecting the appearance (color) of the films. \u00a9 The author.",

Coatings were grown at two pressures of work, 0.4 and 4.0 Pa. The films grown on AISI 304 at a pressure of work of 0.4 showed the highest hardness because they presented a larger grain size and lower roughness. For CrN synthesized at 0.4 Pa, the surface damage was lower during the tribological test. Adherence studies were also carried out, obtaining Lc1 and Lc2 for coatings produced at both pressures and on both substrates. Better adherence behavior was observed for films grown at a low pressure because these films were thicker (~890 nm). \u00a9 The author.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to address the modeling of aspects such as weight reduction (WR), solid gain (SG) and weight-loss (WL) in Caribbean pumpkin samples osmotically dehydrated in ternary solutions. For this purpose, osmotic dehydration was carried out using two ternary solutions: stevia-salt-water (S1) and glucose-salt-water (S2) at different concentrations (20%, 30% and 40% w/w), and processing times of 40 min, 80 min, 120 min, and 160 min. Also, the diffusion coefficient was determined and the analysis of variance with orthogonal polynomials was performed to find the best treatment for dehydration of auyama samples (p\u22640.05). The results suggest that the solution constituted by stevia-salt-water, allows greater reduction of weight and gain of solids when a concentration of 40% is used at a time of 78.12min until reaching a humidity percentage of 60.06%. Similarly, the values of the diffusion coefficient for this solution ratify that the increase in concentration generates less resistance to mass transfer. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

It is considered a complex problem given that it involves different aspects such as the alternatives to evaluate, the multiple criteria involved as well as the group of decision makers with different opinions. In this sense, the literature reports several methods to help in this difficult activity of selecting the best supplier. However, there are still some gaps in these methods; therefore, it is imperative to further develop research. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to report a hybrid method between MOORA and intuitionistic fuzzy sets for the selection of suppliers with a focus on multi-criteria and multi-group environment. The importance of decision makers, criteria and alternatives are evaluated in terms of intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Then, MOORA is used in order to determine the best supplier. An experimental case is developed in order to explain the proposed method in detail and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness. \u00a9 The author.",

A survey that collected information from 71 companies operating in Brazil was carried out, and it was noted that despite the financial methods, market research, and mapping being employed by some firms to base decision making on their product portfolios, most of them rely upon the informal decisions of senior management. In this way, the results of this survey indicate that, in addition to the formal methods, aspects of the influence and bargaining power of leaders must also be considered when analyzing and proposing management practices related to product portfolios. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The sintering process involves a large number of parameters, more than 500, each of which exerts a greater or lesser influence and needs to be controlled, within the possible limits, in order to optimise productivity, process stability, and standardise the composition and quality of the sinter produced. To comply with environmental legislation, a pollution control system must monitor the particle matter and gases generated and emitted into the atmosphere by the sinter plant.

    "Abstract": "This paper presents the first systematic atmospheric corrosion assessment in Bogota. Main facts about the study are related with special characteristics of the City, such as population (more than eight million inhabitants), and altitude (2600 m over the sea level). Relative humidity, temperature, and sulphate dioxide (SO<inf>2</inf>) concentration were measured. Simultaneously, corrosion rate of AISI-SAE 1006 plain steel was measured throughout a year. Results show that atmospheric corrosion is between low and medium levels, C<inf>2</inf>\u2013C<inf>3</inf>, according to the ISO 9223 standard. Nevertheless, estimations from meteorological parameters produce lower corrosivity and, taking into account SO2 concentrations, corrosivity in places with higher relative humidity, are higher than corrosivity measured on steel coupons. In general, the main pollution problem is particulate matter, but higher corrosion rates were directly associated with SO<inf>2</inf> levels. Gaps between found results and international estimation methodologies are evident. Some relative explanations are proposed. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Washing machine manufacturers are working towards producing quieter appliances as many people consider noise emission a key factor when buying. Although the spinning cycle is the noisiest, the amount of noise the pump makes is the cause for many users\u2019 complaints. In an attempt to reduce the noise emitted when a washing machine is pumping out, an experimental study was performed. First, the measurement of the sound pressure allowed us to identify the main sources of noise as the electric motor and the vibration of the cabinet. Next, a detailed analysis based on the measurement of the vibration of the cabinet provided information about the predominant radiating panels. It was also inferred that the electromagnetic noise is drowned out by the structure-borne noise. Finally, several proposals to diminish the sound power were analyzed, and a reduction of 3 dBA was achieved by decreasing the contact zone of the pump with the kick plate. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The severity of these effects is analyzed with 14640 voltage sags, both at the beginning of the voltage sag and when the voltage is recovered, by changing the type, magnitude, duration, and initial-point-of-wave. Four mechanical torque loads were used for the analysis, three with constant behavior and one with quadratic behavior.

INCO electrolyte with glycerin addition induces the formation of ordered porous structures, because glycerin reduces the electrolyte conductivity. Ferritic stainless steel was anodized in electrolyte composed by 2M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> with glycerin addition in different concentrations, without chromium oxide addition. It was observed that the addition of 90 v/v% glycerin promoted a reduction in the electrolyte conductivity, which caused an increase in the anodizing potential.

    "Abstract": "This paper introduces the analysis of a trailer structure made of 6063-T5 aluminum alloy using the Friction Stir-Welding process. The base material and the welded joint were characterized by tension tests. The loads for the structural analysis were obtained from field tests where stresses were measured on critical points at a 2.73 m long 0.95 m width trailer while it was driven on an unpaved road. The stresses on the whole trailer were found by using a finite element model, where the joint with the maximum stresses was identified. This joint was constructed with a tubular structural element using Friction Stir Welding and was evaluated by bending tests. Using the impact factor obtained from the field test, fatigue analysis was performed on the welded joint. It was found that the strength of the joint was sufficient to carry the loads on the trailer. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Salting and subsequent curing are part of the traditional processing method used in the meat and fish industry. Different preserving agents (sodium chloride, nitrite, nitrate, among others) are added in this process. Nowadays, more attention is paid to the amount of salts added and the salting time employed. For this reason, it is important to know the factors governing salt penetration and the most convenient process conditions. The transfer mechanism of the salts through the structure is an interesting aspect in meat and fish processing technology. Mathematical models are the best way to discover the factors, which govern this process, which may represent and explain the observed data and predict the behaviour under different conditions. The objective of this review is to describe the use of the mathematical models to simulate meat and fish salting and the benefits derived from their use. Most of the models used to describe the salting process are diffusional, based on Fick\u2019s second law, although empirical ones are also used. For modelling purposes a good description of the experimental results should be guaranteed. The complexity of the model will depend on the objective to be reached and will be analysed in each case. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Damage in civil structures such as bridges has generally been identified by visual inspections, however dynamic structural health monitoring has been proposed as an alternative. This paper presents the experimental evaluation of three damage identification techniques on a full-scale footbridge. One of the evaluated techniques is based on damage localization vectors. A second technique is based on changes in the mode shapes curvature. The third technique uses a numerical model and artificial neural networks for locating the damaged section. Five scenarios of controlled damage were induced in the footbridge. Output-only ambient vibration tests were performed at each damage state and the results of the identification techniques were analyzed. The three implemented techniques showed promising results for the numerical simulations, and two of these techniques produced satisfactory results in the experimental evaluation. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "A diesel generator was simulated operating with palm oil as fuel and hydrogen doping the inlet air. The objective was to investigate how the addition of hydrogen can accelerate the end of vegetable oil combustion, and consequently improve the electrical efficiency of the generator set up, for the same mass flow rate of fuel. The simulations were performed using AVL BOOST software and validated with experimental data. The generator was simulated operating with 75%, 80% and 100% of the nominal load using palm oil in nature, and hydrogen being injected at the intake manifold in parcels of 5% to a maximum of 20% in energy content by replacing the main fuel. The simulations showed increase in electrical power, reduction in specific fuel consumption, improving the overall efficiency of the generator set with 100% load. Good results were obtained with operation at 75% of the nominal load. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This work presents a study of variance to rotation key encryption processors based on the Fourier transform. It was determined that the key in rectangular coordinates allows a tolerance level of less than 0.2 degrees of rotation of the key in the decryption process. Thus, the solution is to build the key in polar coordinates, by means of circular harmonics expansion; in this way, the tolerance threshold rises to about 40 degrees of rotation of the key in the decryption process. This solution is an added value for optical encryption processors.

The method establishes a defined criterion for accepting or rejecting in real time an entry request to the stacking areas of the port in Valparaiso, Chile. A case study based on expert knowledge illustrates the proposed method with real data. First, the optimum solution is determined for a problem of maximization of entries, based on historical records from the traffic and information center of Valparaiso Port. Second, this solution is used to establish a strategy for making \u201cthe best possible decisions.\u201d The combination of the optimization and the fuzzy results (which consider the type of cargo, prices, and capacity) is performed at two levels. First, the optimization results are used as feed for the fuzzy system to determinate a ratio of future acceptances. Second, the optimization results are compared to the fuzzy system results in order to estimate a parameter to establish the minimal percentage value for accepting a request. As a result, a proper use of the stacking area is achieved, which results in an increase of profits and revenue management. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper addresses the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). For its solution, a hybrid methodology, which uses a Branch and Bound basic algorithm with dominance rules, is developed and implemented, and is combined with four deterministic heuristics whose objective is to prune the search tree branches, taking into account the iterations available and, at the same time, to minimize the probability of discarding branches that contain optimal solutions. Essentially, these strategies allow the allocation of most iterations to the most promissory regions in an organized manner using only subsets with similar or the same characteristics as those of the optimal solutions at each level of the tree, thus assuring a broad search within the feasible region and, simultaneously, a good exploitation by the selective use of the subsets by level. Finally, the developed algorithm performance is analyzed by solving some of the problems of the PSPLIB test library. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we analyze in detail the first Spanish winch used to drain water from mines. It is a privilege of invention designed by Bernave Dombon in 1850. In particular, three-dimensional modeling is performed using software parametric (Catia v5 R21) of each of the elements of the set. Also, after obtaining the 3D model, a static analysis using techniques of Computer-Aided Engineering has been performed, thanks to software of finite element analysis (Simulia Abaqus v6.14-1), based on the analysis of the von Mises stress and displacement. So, the highest stress concentrations occur in the drum shaft and the supporting structure, and that the highest concentration of displacements on the drum shaft too, but the rupture of the elements does not occur in any case, making it a set properly sized. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The topological charge TC of an electromagnetic wave is relate with their wavefront spatial distribution. Electromagnetic waves with factor azimuthal exp(il\u03b8) in its phase, have TC integer (l=m) or non-integer (l=M). These electromagnetic waves with a well-defined of TC can be produced in the visible regime by computer generated holographic masks with fork shaped. In this paper, we study the formed triangle lattice distribution in the intensity Fraunhofer regime using numerical simulations of the Bessel-Gauss beams with integer and non-integer TC. The beam is diffracted by equilateral triangular aperture to measure both their sign and magnitude. In addition, we showed the experimental results of the intensity in far field regime product of diffraction of Bessel-Gauss beams with integer and noninteger TC by the equilateral triangular aperture. Partial and qualitative explanations have been proposed for the diffraction of electromagnetic beams with topological charge. This paper presents a complete analysis for qualitative and quantitative explanation of diffraction of a beam with topological charge by a triangular aperture. The results of such diffraction are obtained by numerical simulation or experimentally. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

With this goal, we propose the application of infrared thermography (IRT) and ground penetrating radar (GPR) for the inspection of radiant heating floors with different floor coatings, in order to evaluate the capabilities and information acquirable with each technique. Specifically, two common floor coatings have been inspected: ceramic tiles and parquet flooring. Results show that each technique provides different information: condition of the pipelines (IRT), geometry and configuration (GPR), concluding that the optimal inspection is constituted by the combination of the two techniques. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "We statistically analysed the chemical components present in waste water from mines in Galicia (NW Spain). These elements pose a risk to public health and the environment, most particularly in the event of a failure in the containment structure of a pond or dam. The statistical processing of the data, which started with an analysis of the typical contaminants present in mining ponds and dams, pointed to the potential limitations of using non-spatial models for spatially structured data. Our results indicate the greater potential of the generalized linear spatial model over the generalized linear model for analysis of spatially structured data. We also show how a misspecification of the model for analysing spatial data can lead to misleading conclusions, which might lead, in turn, to poorly designed protective or corrective measures. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The production of hydrogen by anaerobic fermentation of urban organic waste from fruits and vegetables was studied. Ten tests were carried out under an incomplete factorial experiment design with four factors and three levels. The factors were: acidification pH, acidification time, operational pH, and organic load. The response variables were: maximum hydrogen content (%) and maximum hydrogen production (L/day). The results were fitted to a quadratic polynomial model. In the case of the maximum hydrogen content, an R2 and an R2adjusted of 0.9987 and 0.988 were obtained, respectively. For the maximum production, an R2 and an R2adjusted of 0.9815 and 0.833 were obtained, respectively. Three mathematical techniques were used to obtain the maximum values in the response variables. Fuzzy logic showed the best fit between the experimental values and estimated values. In addition, it predicts a maximum hydrogen content of 58.5% and a maximum production of 63.4 L/day. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "An observational cross-sectional study was carried out with a descriptive approach in a probabilistic sample of 127 drivers with the aim of making a security proposal based on behavior for a public transport company in Colombia. The results show that the most frequent unsafe behaviors in drivers were speeding and not using directional signals. On average, 90% of drivers are aware of the risk of suffering from traffic accidents with deadly consequences when performing unsafe behaviors. The main reasons that drivers had to perform unsafe behaviors were lack of time and traveling without a bus attendant. The incentives that motivate a greater number of drivers to perform safe behaviours are rest time, receiving a bonus and recreation. The procedures of prevention that can produce a greater reduction of unsafe behaviors are: training plan, feedback, positive reinforcement and negative punishment. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The fixation of arsenic contained in gases produced during pyrometallurgical processes by using solid ferric oxide was studied in the range 873-1073 K under different oxygen potential and solid aggregates porosities. Arsenic fixation on solid iron oxides is described by the pore blocking model under the studied conditions. The solid product of the reaction has a molar volume 3 times larger than the solid reactant causing fast decreasing of the inter-granular spacing. The activation energies of arsenic fixation reaction are 34.96 and 35.46 kJ/mol for porosities of 0.88 and 0.74 respectively, and for porosity of 0.55 the activation energy was 26.88 kJ/mol. These values of activation energy show that intra-pellets diffusion has an effect only in samples with 0.55 porosity. Minor sintering of particles was detected. Industrial application of the concept demands a reaction system, which in is required better gas-solid contact for attaining larger conversions. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The tailings dam \u201cLa Luciana\u201d failed causing the death of eighteen people. After the fault, the mining company carried out several geotechnical tests in the remaining materials of the tailings dam. The results are available to be consulted in the Reoc\u00edn Mines Documentary Collection, from which we have obtained mechanical Cone Penetration Test (CPT) data near the fault area as well as diverse maps of the dam pre-failure and post-failure.

A trigeneration system produces electricity, heat and cooling effect using electricity or heat available. Emphasis is made on systems using absorption chillers, including one using a hybrid absorption ejecto-compression chiller, here called tetra-combined trigeneration system. The performance evaluation of systems is carried out by the application of exergy and exergoeconomic analysis of the proposed alternatives in order to determine exergy efficiency and exergy based costs on production of system utilities. The Genetic Algorithms method has been chosen for optimization to show the applicability of evolutionary techniques in trigeneration plants.

Thus, the regenerated Fuller earth without any modification reached 99% removal of methylene blue. However, for treatment of effluents contaminated with red 40, acid and thermal modification of material was required to obtain adsorption greater than 94% of the dye. In conclusion, regenerated Fuller earth adsorbent is suitable for treating effluents contaminated with cationic coloring materials.

However, this area is almost never discussed because of its complexity due to the large number of signals that appear in it. In this work, the fingerprint region analysis of the ethylene\u2013vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) with different percentages of vinyl acetate (VA) (18%, 28%, 40%) was performed. In comparison with other instrumental techniques, the crystallinity and structural arrangement of the EVA copolymers were determined simply and economically. The crystallinities for EVA18, EVA28 and EVA40 were 24.39%, 6.95% and 1.03%, respectively. In terms of structural ordering, the number of linear chains of EVA copolymer decreases as the concentration of VA increases, which favors the reduction of degrees of freedom and the formation of hydrogen bonds. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents the development of a system aimed to facilitate the communication and interaction of people with severe hearing impairment with other people. The system employs artificial vision techniques to the recognition of static signs of Colombian Sign Language (LSC). The system has four stages: Image capture, preprocessing, feature extraction and recognition. The image is captured by a digital camera TRDB-D5M for Altera\u2019s DE1 and DE2 development boards. In the preprocessing stage, the sign is extracted from the background of the image using the thresholding segmentation method; then, the segmented image is filtered using a morphological operation to remove the noise. The feature extraction stage is based on the creation of two vectors to characterize the shape of the hand used to make the sign. The recognition stage is made up a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP), which functions as a classifier. The system was implemented in the Altera\u2019s Cyclone II FPGA EP2C70F896C6 device and does not require the use of gloves or visual markers for its proper operation. The results show that the system is able to recognize all the 23 signs of the LSC with a recognition rate of 98.15%. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This coordination strategy looks for the alignment of agents and processes around the efficient freight handling by minimizing costs and allowing the proper use of transportation capacity resources. The contribution of this paper relies on the analysis of benefits regarding freight consolidation strategies in the context of Agricultural Supply Chains (ASC) by using a simulation approach. The results of a discrete-event simulation with one commodity product evaluated in three different scenarios prove the benefits of this coordination strategy by reducing the number of annual shipments from 1732 to 725 in a city logistics context and increasing fleet utilization levels up to 71%. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Among the environmental management approaches, the concept of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) has become one of the most important in recent years. The GSCM approach addresses all processes and activities that make up the supply chain echelons (procurement, manufacturing and delivery), also including design, purchasing, marketing and reverse logistics. Although the literature review identified the existence of a variety of environmental performance indicators framed the Pressure-State-Response approach, indicators applied under the GSCM approach were not found. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology for the construction of a multicriteria indicator to measure the environmental performance under the GSCM approach, based on 8 processes and 32 activities identified from the literature review. The indicator was applied in a group of 14 companies in the coffee region of Colombia. The results indicate a heterogeneous performance among the companies and a significant lag in some of the analyzed processes. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Integrating emerging technologies has shown to have the potential to improve access to rehabilitation services and the adherence for physical therapy when they are applied into telemedicine environments. This systematic review aims to explore telerehabilitation systems that use motion capture and video games for upper-limb rehabilitation purposes. Motion capture was focused on the information fusion from inertial sensors and other technologies. The search was limited to 2010-2013, from which 667 papers were obtained; afterwards, duplicate papers were removed, thus, reducing the sample to 57 papers with full text availability. Finally, only 3 of them were selected by approaching the subject of this study. We conclude that the fusion information from inertial sensors and other motion capture technologies appears to be a new tendency in remote monitoring of motor rehabilitation process. However, the combination of them with active video games in physiotherapy programs is only an emerging research area with promising results. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The coating without heat treatment includes the follow species: Al13Fe4, Fe2Al5, FeAl2 and Al5FeNi for both steels. In addition, the heat treatment causes the aluminum to diffuse into the substrate and the iron diffuse towards the surface of the coating, making the transformation of previous existing compounds to FeAl, Fe2Al5, FeAl2, Al0.99Fe0.99Ni0.02, AlNi and Fe2AlCr. Thermodynamic simulation was conducted with the Thermo-Calc software to obtain information of the possible composition and amount of deposited material, for selected conditions. The specimens coated and uncoated were exposed at 750 \u00baC in an atmosphere where the vapor was transported to the samples using a N2 flow of 40 ml/min plus 100% water vapor (H2O). The two uncoated substrates behaved differently, since the steel AISI 304 performed well and gained little weight (0.49 mg/cm2), compared to the steel AISI 316 that lost too much weight (25.4 mg/cm2). Coated steels gained little weight during thousand hours of exposure (0.26 mg/cm2) and support very well the corrosive attack compared to uncoated substrates. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Asphaltene aggregation process was studied using molecular dynamics techniques. Four different structures were used. The first three molecules have a continental structure, with condensed aromatic cores, while the forth has an archipelago structure, with small groups of aromatic rings connected with saturated chains. The molecules were constructed in an atomistic framework, in which atoms are described individually. Interaction forces were calculated at 300 K and 200 atm; Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were evaluated separately. For all four molecules the solubility parameter was calculated. It was found that Van der Waals interactions due to the presence of aromatic rings and electrostatic forces caused by the presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, are equally relevant in the aggregation of asphaltene molecules. For all molecules it was found asphaltene systems are more stable in aggregation state than in monomeric state. For continental structures, the presence of long ramifications obstructs the formation of asphaltene aggregates. For archipelago structures, the flexibility of the molecules enables the aggregation with other structures. The presence of heteroatoms creates a repulsive force that hinders the aggregation process. The molecular volume and the cohesive energy are also sensitive to the geometric configuration and the composition of the species, which affects the solubility parameter. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper further explores the physics of water condensation, using an experimental structure designed for that purpose. The data show a highly significant correlation (R2 &gt;0.94, p value &lt;0.001) between observed airflows and partial pressure changes from condensation, when the results of different experiments are pooled. Changes in air density on cooling provide insufficient energy to account for the airflow. The finding is that the kinetic energy of the chilled air falls short by an order of magnitude, even to move a relatively small proportion of the 20 kg of air contained within the structure. Meanwhile the physics of condensation indicate a surplus of kinetic energy is made available from the air surrounding the locus of condensation. At low rates of condensation a considerable proportion of the available kinetic energy in the enclosed air is absorbed in friction and turbulence. That proportion reduces with higher rates of condensation. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper addresses the Capacitated Location-Routing Problem (CLRP) in which the aim is to determine the depots to be opened, the customers to be assigned to each open depot, and the routes to be performed to fulfill the demand of the customers. The objective is to minimize the sum of the cost of the open depots, of the used vehicle costs, and of the variable costs associated with the distance traveled by the performed routes. In this paper, a Granular Tabu Search (GTS) with different diversification strategies within a Iterated Local Search (ILS) is proposed to solve the CLRP. A shaking procedure is applied whenever the best solution found so far is not improved for a given number of iterations. Computational experiments on benchmark instances taken from the literature show that the proposed approach is able to obtain, within short computing times, high quality solutions illustrating its effectiveness. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

To determine the energy of formation, the total energy for TiN, TiC, and CN compounds was calculated. Finally, we determined the DOS (density of states) of the two multilayers.

    "Abstract": "Rice husk was agglomerated using different starch in order to obtain a required physical stability, with no effect in the thermal insulation properties. A process was developed using Saccharomyces Cerevisiae to produce the interior cavities in the agglomerate. The material was subjected to heating, loading, and to the ASTM C 177 test to evaluate the thermal conductivity. The tests showed that the material supports direct fire without producing any flame, it has an ultimate strength of 80-120 kPa when tested at temperatures ranging between 150-200 C. The thermal conductivity was found close to 0.09 W/m.K. At outdoor conditions (Dry bulb temperature: 30\u00b0C \u00b1 5\u00b0C, Relative humidity: 80% \u00b1 15%) the material was not attacked by natural fungus. The material can be recycled easily by nature, dissolving in the presence of water. These properties showed that the rice husk base agglomerated is an efficient thermal insulation, with an acceptable physical and chemical stability, suitable for engineering applications and environmental friendly. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The calibration and validation comprise the period of July-2013 to June-2016 with daily data. The Soil Moisture Accounting (SMA) method was used to compute the water flow in the soil. For the rainfall distribution, the Thiessen method was used, while the Evapotranspiration was calculated with the Penman-Monteith equation. The results revealed that (1) 83% of the water infiltrates the soil while only 17% is retained in plants and the soil surface, (2) the water is retained for approximately 42 days before reaching the river and (3) that more than 60% of the flow corresponds to sub-surface flow. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "High growth in electricity demand and peaks in the load curve, caused mainly by households, require big investments in infrastructure that are used for short periods. Because of this, it is necessary to look for new developments that allow meeting the needs of users as well as using the electricity system resources efficiently. This is possible through the Smart Grid (SG), which additionally allows users to have autonomy in the electricity supply chain. Our focus of investigation is with households because they can monitor their demand and help to reduce the peaks of the load curve. To do this, users must use Smart Meters, because these devices allow consumers to obtain the information necessary to control their demand. This paper presents a systematic analysis of published literature related to the study of the SG from the demand side, analyses the current situation of this topic and the impact of Smart Meter penetration in households.",

The EV test bench is composed of an induction motor (IM) drive, which is directly coupled to a dc machine and to an inertial flywheel through a transmission system with bands. The inertial flywheel and the DC machine reproduce the dynamic and forces acting on the E V. A methodology is proposed to design EV test bench to study the EV behavior close to the real test conditions. The EV forces and DC machine analysis can define the different conditions of the EV operation. The modeling and simulation are developed in MATLAB/Simulink, the test bench implemented is controlled by a DSP. Finally, simulation and experimental obtained results can validate the operation of the test bench emulator.",

    "Abstract": "In Colombia the agro-industrial process of fique generates approximately 20 800 kg of waste/ha planted, consisting of bagasse and juice. These wastes are discarded over soil and water generating a problem of environmental pollution. The fique bagasse (FB) has a calorific value of 3 297.91 kcal/kg, high concentrations of cellulose, hemicellulose and C/N ratio that make it appropriate for biogas production. However, the presence of lignin in the FB requires specific microbial consortia for its degradation. Therefore, in this research the biogas production from FB on a laboratory scale was studied through the Anaerobic Digestion (AD) process using a consortium of ruminal fluid (RF) and pig manure (PM). A methane production of 0.35 m3 CH4/kg volatile solids (VS) added during two weeks, equivalent to 1.38 kWh/kg VS added, indicated that FB is an attractive residual to be used as a source of renewable energy.",

    "Abstract": "Structural damage detection has become an important research topic in certain segments of the engineering community. These methodologies occasionally formulate an optimization problem by defining an objective function based on dynamic parameters, with metaheuristics used to find the solution. In this study, damage localization and quantification is performed by an Adaptive Differential Evolution algorithm, which solves the associated optimization problem. Furthermore, this paper looks at the proposed methodology\u2019s performance when using different functions based on natural frequencies, mode shapes, modal flexibilities, modal strain energies and the residual force vector. Simple and multiple damage scenarios are numerically imposed on truss structures to assess the performance of the proposed methodology. Results show that damage scenarios can be reliably determined by using the analyzed objective functions. However, the methodology does not perform well when the objective function based on natural frequencies and modal strain energies is employed. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

It is considered a realistic seismic record of 8.1Mw occurred at Mexico City, containing some resonant frequencies of the structure. The mechanical structure is modeled using Euler-Lagrange methodology and validated using experimental modal analysis techniques. The active control scheme is synthesized to actively attenuate the noise and vibration system response, caused by noisy excitation forces acting on the base, by employing Multiple Positive Position Feedback and Sliding Mode Control to improve the closed-loop system response and, simultaneously, attenuate three vibration modes.

    "Abstract": "The paving-heavy crude oils (PHCO) are natural cut-back asphalts that can be used for unconventional paving solutions for low-and medium-traffic roads given their lower cost in comparison with conventional asphalt binders (i.e., produced through industrial oil refining). Despite their potential, the characterization and use of PHCO for road paving is still limited. This study focuses on assessing the adhesion quality and rheological properties of both unmodified and nano-modified asphalt residues (AR) obtained from two sources of PHOC. The results suggest that the AR offer smaller stiffness and develop asphalt-aggregate interfaces with lower adhesion quality as compared to those generated by the control conventional asphalt. In general, the nano-modifier addition led to lower stiffness values for the AR, and although it improved the adhesion in dry condition, the susceptibility to moisture damage at the asphalt-aggregate interfaces was not reduced. Future research is suggested to validate these findings by assessing asphalt mixtures. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

In order to do that, we developed a financial model, which considers the initial investment, cost of battery replacement, efficiency loss of photovoltaic technology and discount rate, among other variables, to determine the solar technology investment feasibility. It was found, in the base scenario, that on 2014 most of the considered cities have reached grid parity, while three of them will reach it between 2015 and 2021.

This paper aims at summarizing these practical lessons, to facilitate their future application and further developments, in terms of: (i) fabrication of laboratory specimens, (ii) comparison of laboratory- and field-compacted mixtures, (iii) comparison of hot-mix asphalt and warm-mix asphalt mixtures, (iv) effects of additives, temperature, and compaction, (v) stone-on-stone contact, (vi) relationship between internal structure and performance, and (vii) modeling applications. These practical lessons are primarily gathered from the analysis of the air void distribution of laboratory-and field-produced AM, evaluated through X-ray CT, which has led to relevant inputs for the assessment of the response and performance of AM. X-ray CT enables computation of the AM internal structure with multiple practical applications and future opportunities to enhance the microstructure of AM and, consequently, optimize their performance. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The tribological and mechanical properties of various cast irons with different contents of carbon and silicon are studied. The Brinell hardness or every cast iron was measured and their wear resistance was calculated according to ASTM G99 standard, \"Standard Test Method for Wear Testing with a Pin-on-Disk Apparatus. These results were related to microstructure, composition and casting processes of the cast irons. The best wear behaviour was experienced by the cast irons with spheroidal graphite and a ferrite matrix in their microstructure. At the same time, the cast irons with the lowest wear resistance are those that have flaky graphite and a purely ferrite matrix in their microstructure. In addition, various casting processes have been tested in order to determine their influence on the appearance of spheroidal graphite. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Disadvantages of compressed earth blocks are their poor mechanical properties and low resistance to water damage. Therefore, their use is vulnerable to deterioration and require care and maintenance, which depends on the degree of stabilization and compaction of the clay soil. Gypsum mining wastes and lime used as stabilization materials to improve the properties of these construction materials. The compressive and flexural strength, softening in water, drying shrinkage and unit weight determined. Strength values increased with both mining waste additions. Highest resistance against softening in water obtained with a 25% of mining waste. Drying shrinkage reduced with increasing mining waste content. Dry unit weight was not in the recommended standards. Results showed that gypsum mining wastes can be used as alternative materials to stabilize compressed earth blocks. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Tests were performed using synthetic solutions with Cu2+ concentration and acidity similar to those of a copper electro-refining industrial electrolyte by means of rotating disc electrode (RDE) technique. The diffusion coefficient was calculated according to Levich\u2019s expression from measurements of limiting current for different rotating speed of the RDE. Arrhenius dependence of the diffusion coefficient with temperature in the absence of additives was verified. In presence of additives, the variation of the limiting current is mainly attributed to changes in diffusion coefficient of cupric ion observed. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Here is studied the variation in cohesion of cement main phase (C-S-H) as a result of cationic polyelectrolytes addition (quaternary amines spermine and norspermidine). Cohesion study was carried out by molecular simulation techniques (Monte Carlo) using a primitive model in a canonical ensemble (NVT). The proposed model takes into account the influence of ionic size of each particle and the addition of polyelectrolytes with different charge number and separation. The results obtained show that electrostatic interactions are responsible for the cohesion of the hardened cement. It was found that in absence of cationic polyelectrolytes, cohesion is lost when the C-S-H lamellae are at separations larger than 1 nm. Adding cationic polyelectrolytes generates a distribution of hydroxide ions around the polyelectrolyte charges, facilitates the distribution of calcium and sodium ions in the entire space between C-S-H surfaces; this allows the cohesive forces exist at greater distances of separation between the surfaces. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Raman Spectroscopy Imaging requires long periods of time for the data acquisition and subsequent treatment of the spectral chemical images. Recently, Compressed Sensing (CS) technique has been used satisfactorily in Raman Spectroscopy Imaging, reducing the acquisition time by simultaneously sensing and compressing the underlying Raman spectral signals. The Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imager (CASSI) is an optical architecture that applied effectively the CS technique in Raman Spectroscopy Imaging. The main optical element of CASSI system is a coded aperture, which can transmit or block the information from the underlying scene. The principal design variable in the coded apertures is the percentage of transmissive elements or transmittance. This paper describes the technique of CS in Raman Spectroscopy imaging by using the CASSI system and realizes the selection of the optimal transmittance values of the coded apertures to ensure an efficient recovery of Raman Images. Diverse simulations are performed to determine the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the reconstructed Raman data cubes as a function of the transmittance of the coded apertures, the size of the underlying Raman data cubes and the number of projections expressed in terms of the compression ratio. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

An analysis of the state of the art of this technology shows the selection of the working fluid as an open research line, since until now there is no fluid that can meet all environmental and technical aspects to be considered in these cycles. Hence, we have developed a series of simulations that allow us to study the behavior of the Rankine cycle with different configurations and fluids (wet, dry and isentropic) which has led us to observe the influence on the overall cycle efficiency when we change the type of fluids used (refrigerants, hydrocarbons and water) as well as the conditions of temperature, pressure, flow, etc. With the work realized, the viability of this type of processes is demonstrated for the recovery of heat in industry and/or the use of renewable sources of low and medium temperature for the production of electricity. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Hot air drying was performed at 50, 60 and 70\u00baC. Drying kinetics of osmodehydrated samples was compared to untreated samples. Effective moisture diffusion coefficients were determined. Values of activation energy were 29.56 and 16.93 kJ mol-1 for pretreated samples and untreated samples, respectively. Mathematical modeling was applied to simulate the experimental drying curves of pitahayas. Results indicated that the Weibull model could be used to simulate experimental drying data.

Electrochemical behavior was evaluated by open circuit potential (OCP), potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Results showed that siloxane-PMMA film obtained with a higher addition of TEOS had higher thickness. However, intense densification caused by TEOS addition promoted crack formation, thereby compromising the corrosion resistance. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a dynamic architecture for convergent wired and wireless access networks in Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) based Passive Optical Network (PON) featuring wavelength stacking. Four wavelengths for wired services carrying 10 Gb/s traffic load, one shared extra reconfigurable wavelength and one wavelength common to all Optical Network Units (ONUs) for the transport of wireless services were launched into a 1:64 splitting ratio PON network. In the ONU, a tunable free spaced Fourier optics based filter selects one of the wavelengths conveying wired services and a tunable Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) filters out the wavelength carrying the wireless services. In the uplink direction, subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) was used for the combined transport of the wired and wireless signals to the Central Office (CO). \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Several conurbations in Latin America have implemented policies to restrict the use of private cars by prohibiting those with a license plate number ending on some digit, which vary each day, from circulating on that weekday. These policies have been formulated as a \u201csecond best\u201d option to congestion charging as the latter policy has been deemed politically unfeasible so far. The idea underlying license plate restrictions is very simple: by not allowing a proportion of the total number of vehicles to circulate on a given day, congestion levels and other externalities are expected to decrease, improving the quality of life for people.Based on a simple microeconomic analysis, supported by a review of the literature and by evidence collected in several cities where these restrictions have been implemented, it is concluded that the policy is apparently effective only in the very short-term, but ultimately it fails to achieve its objectives and usually leads to a worse outcome. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Several authors have treated the optimization of passive filters in electric distribution systems. Optimization methods like: sequential quadratic programming (SQP), simulated annealing (SA), differential evolution (DE), artificial neural networks (ANN), particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), etc., have been employed for optimizing certain configurations of passive filters. These optimization methods have been employed to solve several formulations of the problem of the project of filters. These formulations can be classified in: formulations of one or several objectives. The objective of the present work is to show the evolution of the formulation of this problem in the lasts years respect to the objective functions and constraints used. This analysis shows how the formulations employed have been upgraded from single-objective to multi-objective formulations to achieve a better representation of this complex problem.

Hence, this study proposes three stepping-stones for Big Data integration in e-government decision-making: production, management and application. The proposed framework aims to be a reference in South America for Big Data adoption in e-government and, thus, help to mitigate the technology delay regarding other regions.

    "Abstract": "In recent years, the different transport systems have been largely improved. However, some problems need to be still solved if railways want to be the transport of the future. Among others: the high cost of infrastructure and its maintenance, the requirements to assure low noise levels and low transmission of vibration.The turnouts, one of the most critical elements on the track, are studied in this paper. Mathematical models have been developed in order to analyse in detail a vehicle passing through a turnout. These models are used to implement multibody models, which reproduce the phenomena of the vehicle/turnout interaction.The research analyses the validity and accuracy of multibody tools and how they could allow improving the design process of turnouts. In particular the influence of the turnout geometry and track elasticity has been investigated and also how these parameters could be optimized. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The present paper implements a novelty semi-active structural control design on a two-story building, with the aim of reducing vibrations caused by transient type loads. The analyzed structure corresponds to an experimental prototype that was fully characterized and modeled according to the diaphragm hypothesis. The controller used was based on the action of a pair of real magnetorheological (MR) dampers whose operation is emulated by the phenomenological model. These mechanisms are governed by a numerical system that is based on non-linear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (NARX)-type artificial neural networks, which have the ability to determine the necessary optimal control forces and the voltages required for the development of these forces through a prediction model and an inverse model, which are pioneers in this kind of systems. The results obtained show that the control design based on neural networks that was developed in the present study is a reliable and efficient, achieving reductions of up to 69% for the peak response value. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Accumulation of unmanaged agroindustrial solid wastes especially in developing countries has resulted in an increased environmental concern. Recycling of such wastes as a sustainable construction material appears to be a viable solution not only to the pollution problem but also an economical option to design green buildings. This paper studies the application of several agroindustrial wastes in brick manufacturing, which include cocoa shell, sawdust, rice husk and sugarcane. First, the mineralogical and chemical composition of the wastes and clayey soil were determined. Next, bricks were fabricated with different quantities of waste (5%, 10% and 20%). The effect of adding these wastes on the technological behavior of the brick was assessed by compressive strength, flexural strength and durability tests. Based on the results obtained, the optimum amounts of agroindustrial waste to obtain bricks were mixing 10% of cocoa shell and 90% of clayey soil. These percentages produced bricks whose mechanical properties were suitable for use as secondary raw materials in the brick production. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The model is based on the definition of both the electrical field and power at the output of the optical modulator for baseband and radiofrequency modulated signals. By modeling the electrical field, it was found a trade-off between the modulation depths of both signals; as well as the their optimum value in order to assure a good signal quality in reception. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

To protect themselves against fraud, crises and problems inherent to family organizations, these corporations need to implement at least basic corporate governance recommendations. This study aims to evaluate the practices suggested by the Brazilian Institute of Corporate Governance (IBGC) based on a survey of 33 Brazilian organizations for convenience. Our results indicate that construction companies in the country start their governance models by standardizing and professionalizing their business; however, they only start considering the family influence in later stages. The average scores obtained for the recommendations investigated suggest poor implementation of corporate governance practices in Brazilian family construction companies. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Thus, it is strongly recommended that these variants are further analyzed, especially for the solution of systems of nonlinear equations, since the exploratory test that has been performed yielded good results (i.e. the roots found by the algorithm were quite close to the theoretical one). Moreover, it was also found that the algorithm is dependent on the swarm size, especially when dealing with planar regions. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this work was to make a qualitative analysis of the distribution of copper deposit inside of stainless steel and graphite porous electrodes. For that, representative sections of steel and graphite samples were analyzed by stereoscopic microscopy, SEM-XRD analysis and image analysis by software Scentis Struers Software\u00ae. The analysis showed that the copper is not deposited uniformly over the electrode thickness. For steel electrode, the deposit depth in the thickness was around 50%, while graphite electrode about 90% of the thickness. In general, an increase of the deposit towards the end facing the anode was observed and with different sites of copper deposit growth. This behavior shows a current and voltage distribution which is a function of the physical parameters of electrode, and physicochemical and hydrodynamic characteristics of the electrolyte. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

For the analysis, we evaluate two different approaches for model estimation: the maximum likelihood estimation (classical) and the Bayesian estimation, allowing a comparison between both approaches when are used to estimate the subjective value of time (SVT) as the marginal rate of substitution between time and cost. We found that the average SVT when we used the classical estimation is US$0.14/min; meanwhile, the access time was US$0.21/min and the penalty for a transfer is US$0.74. On the other hand, the average values estimated when using Bayesian approach were US$0.15/min for the SVT in vehicle, US$0.21/min for the access time and US$0.83 for the transfer penalty. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents an alternative method to O-D matrix for estimating road occupancy of urban goods movement (UGM). The originality of the model arises on three elements. The first is that the modelling unit is the delivery operation, with all the elements that are associated to it. The second is that it follows an inductive approach, starting from a rich database, to define different generation functions without a priori applying a defined mathematical framework. The third is that the model is an emission one, i.e. we start generating the number of deliveries that are shipped by the different urban establishments, and not those attracted by them. First, the literature in the field is reviewed. Then, the main methodological elements are presented. We present here the delivery generation procedure and the route definition method. Finally, validation results for both parts of the model are critically discussed. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

A modified Devanathan\u00b4s cell was used in the experiments. This cell allows the injection of an electrolyte flux over the hydrogen exit side during the permeation tests. In the hydrogen generation compartment a NaOH 0.1M + 2mgL-1 As2O3 solution was used applying a constant current of 2.85 mA. The detection side was maintained under potentiostatic control at potential values in the passivity range for iron. The solution used in the exit compartment was a borate buffer (pH=8.4). It was not observed a significant variation of the permeation current when an electrolyte flow was injected on iron samples, however, a slightly raise both of the steady state of permeation current density and the calculated permeation parameters was observed in the tests in which an electrolyte flux was applied. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This probability density function was applied to a landslides inventory mapped outside the city of Medell\u00edn, distinguishing between landslides (in natural slopes) and slope failures (so called man-made slopes). As a result, the statistic behavior of large landslides is very similar to the theoretical curve presented by the authors referred above, while the probability of occurrence of small landslides, those with areas smaller than 5x10-4 km2, is much higher, especially on man-made slope failures. Considering that this behavior is clearly manifested on man-made slope failures, it can be inferred that there is an effect of the road on the increase of the periodicity of the slides and there for, the popular hypothesis of associating road slope failure only to precipitation is questionable. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Electrodissolution of aluminum in solutions containing chloride or sulfate ions during electrocoagulation acid whey, has been the objective of this work. The alkaline pH increases the rate of dissolution by several orders of magnitude. The electrolytic medium (Cl- or SO42-) does not seem to significantly influence the dissolution of aluminum, but increase the charge density, which helps in the electrochemical process. The results are related to the nature of aluminum hydroxide species formed during anodic dissolution. In acidic and neutral conditions, OH-ions from the cathode do not fully participate in the formation of neutral species of aluminum hydroxide and excess OH-ions increases the pH of the medium. In contrast, the pH decreases in highly alkaline conditions attributed to the consumption of large amounts of OH-ions to form an anionic species such as Al(OH)4-and Al(OH)52-, and other polymeric species of aluminun. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The simultaneous analysis of production scheduling and preventive maintenance task attracts special attention of researchers due to its complexity and therefore the necessity to seek efficient methods for solving this kind of combinatorial problems. This paper presents a heuristic approach to solve this issue on job shop plants. The solution method includes a linear programming model, based on the Traveling Salesman Problem, where the setup time is considered as distance measure. The method\u00b4s aim is to obtain a sequence of production orders and preventive maintenance tasks that reduce the idle time and the backlogs simultaneously, accomplishing the maintenance program. After finding an optimal solution for each machine a Correction Factor (CF) is determined as new distance measure. The CF considers the structure of the initial solution, the machine utilization and the product priorities. Then, the final solution is reached running the linear programming model using the distance updated values. Finally, the proposed heuristic is applied to real case study of the Cuban industry. The experimental results indicated a significant idle time reduction for the company under examination. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The distillery vinasse is the most important liquid effluent of the ethanol production process and it is characterized by a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD); besides its acid pH and dark brown color. Phenol content in vinasse causes inhibitory effects on anaerobic digestion processes and has an adverse environmental impact. An alternative for treating vinasse from distilleries by using the electro-dissolution of iron and a heterocoagulation stage with Ca(OH)2 as a pretreatment was evaluated. Removals of 92% in phenols and 52% in chemical oxygen demand (COD) were obtained. Then, the pretreated vinasse was undergone to an anaerobic digestion process. Global removals to around 93% in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), 83% in COD, and over 99% in total phenols were obtained. Finally, an eco-toxicological evaluation using Daphnia pulex was carried out, and it was found that the coupling treatment increased the medium lethal concentration (LC50) to around 190%. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The use of Bayesian techniques for the identification of accident-prone road sections has become very important in recent years. The objective of this investigation consisted of identifying accident-prone road sections in the Municipality of Oca\u00f1a (Colombia) using the Bayesian Method (BM); the modeling approach developed involved the creation of a database of accidents that occurred between the years 2007 (January) and 2013 (August) and the application of the methodology on 15 sections of urban road. The final analyses show that the BM is an original and fast tool that is easily implemented, it provides results in which 4 accident-prone or dangerous road sections were identified and ranked them in order of danger, establishing a danger ranking that provides a prioritization for investments and the implementation of preventive and/or corrective policies that will maximize benefits associated with road safety. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) \u2014conformed by the main scientific publishers\u2014 has warned about the increasing number of ethical problems in scientific publication and recent scandals seem to indicate that ethical misconduct is repetitive. Ethical problems in scientific publication arise when the person deviates from expected moral behavior. Misconduct may be explained, at least in part, because many postgraduate students and young researchers seem to understand that ethical problems are only related to plagiarism of complete works or duplication of publications, and because it seems to be a lack of knowledge of the ethical standards in scientific publication. However, there are many other aspects conducing to ethical problems. The objective of this paper is to discuss and spread the ethical position of the main scientific publishers and researchers with the aim of build a unified point of view. In this paper, seventeen tips for avoiding ethical problems in scientific publication are presented, explained and discussed. I hope that this work will be valuable for postgraduate students and young researchers and answers many common questions about ethics in scientific publication. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the coagulant power of 5 natural combinations to clarify the water of a wetland. The clarification process was simulated with the jar test and a rapid agitation at 120 rpm was established for this test for 1 minute, slow agitation at 30 rpm for 20 minutes and sedimentation for 15 minutes. For the natural combinations, a ratio of 90-10, 80-20, 70-30, 60-40, and 50-50 yucca-seeds of Moringa oleifera was determined. After the process, the turbidity of the water was compared with a control sample. It was determined that the best results were obtained with treatment 2, 4 and 5 that removed the turbidity of the water from the wetland in 89.7%, 93.0 and 93.4% and 93.4% respectively. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, the determination of the diameter of zeolite as a support for a microbial aerobic fluidized bed reactor is performed. The design of the reactor is recommended by Navarro and Palladino [1]. For the present study, the zeolite is crushed and classified granulometrically. Subsequently, the diameters of 0.5, 1 and 2 mm are arbitrarily chosen for the study of microbial adhesion. After the study of adherence of nitrifying bacteria, the obtained adhesion values for each diameter are not significantly different from each other. However, 1 mm is chosen to achieve higher adhesion values. Subsequently the aerobic fluidized bed reactor proposed by Navarro and Palladino [1] is built with the 1 mm-diameter zeolite. This presented an inlet flow of 1.35 mL.min-1 and a capacity of 8 L. The optimized quantity of zeolite for proper fluidization is 500 g, which is an 8% of total volume of the column. During operation, a good efficiency of reduction of the organic material is observed (50%). \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Conceptual design is one of the earliest stages of product development, and is responsible for defining key aspects of the final product. The systematic approach addresses this stage by using a disaggregate model of product attributes and their corresponding geometries. This ultimately serves as a starting point for exploring conceptual proposals. Research into the emergence of various sketch typologies shows that they are labeled according to aim rather than technical utility. The proposed sketch-based model is intended to serve as a comprehensive version of the systematic model for conceptual design (Hernandis & Briede, 2009). Sketch outlines are used during various stages of the model in order to enable and visually assist with cognitive processes and decision-making during the initial theoretical stages, which are abstract and poorly defined. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The use of crystal polystyrene for high performance components requires knowledge of the distribution of residual stresses. The aim of this research was to analyze the influence of the molding temperature and cooling time on the residual stresses present in parts of two types of crystal polystyrene PS1 and PS2, processed by injection molding.The results obtained using photoelasticity showed that at low temperatures the residual stresses increase due to the processes of formation and destruction of intermolecular forces. Internal stresses were reduced in the polymer specimens with greater thickness because the molecular relaxation of chains of polystyrene is facilitated by the space increase between the walls of the mold. It was concluded that the photoelasticity technique can be applied effectively in the measurement of residual stresses in injection molded crystal polystyrene parts. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The use of public bicycle systems has gained great importance in European countries and around the globe; this has led to the need to seek advanced techniques to help decision making. A public bicycle system consists of a set of points where you can pick up and deliver bicycles; a headquarters where a group of vehicles taking leftover bikes and transported to the points where a deficit (the demand exceeds supply) exists. One of the major problems that arise in systems of public bike is balanced, which involves sending bikes from the point where an offer (bicycles left over) to the point where there is a demand (bikes missing) occurs. The way to model this problem is with an adaptation of the vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery (VRPPD), allowing each route make partial deliveries to customers and limiting the number of customers to visit by each route. In this paper an integer linear programming model is introduced and a metaheuristic based on granular tabu search to find a local optimum. Instances from 15 to 500 customers adapted from the literature are used. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm finds solutions in short computational time. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The replacement of Pb-Sn welding for lead-free alloys to attach components in printed circuit boards is an attempt to minimize the problem of Pb toxicity, but it does not change the problem of separation of the components for later reuse and/or recycling. This article presents a review of the environmental problem of printed circuit boards, the initial development of alternative fixation studies, and reliability tests for comparison with conventional boards and commercial systems to validate or serve as a basis for future research, focused on PCB disassembly for recycling.

    "Abstract": "Due to its scalability and flexibility, Network-on-Chip (NoC) is a growing and promising communication paradigm for Multiprocessor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) design. As the manufacturing process scales down to the deep submicron domain and the complexity of the system increases, fault-tolerant design strategies are gaining increased relevance. This paper exhibits the use of a Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) algorithm aimed at finding the best mapping solutions at design time, as well as to finding the optimal remapping solution, in presence of single-node failures on the NoC. The optimization objectives in both cases are the application completion time and the network's peak bandwidth. A deterministic XY routing algorithm was used in order to simulate the traffic conditions in the network which has a 2D mesh topology. Obtained results are promising. The proposed algorithm exhibits a better performance, when compared with other reported approaches, as the problem size increases. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

On top of samples, macroindentation tests were carried out to characterize the film to substrate adherence according to the recommended VDI 3198 procedure. Sputter deposition experiments varying both chamber pressure and target applied power were carried out. All films displayed superior adhesion to the substrates. A non-monotonic relationship between adherence and chamber pressure or target applied power was observed. The lowest adherences were associated with intermediate pressures and powers. The outstanding film to substrate adherence was mainly addressed to monophasic and nanometric film character (crystallite size was roughly 20 \u00b1 10 nm) and to rather high continuity and homogeneity of films. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Abundant literature is available for the route planning based on meta-heuristic algorithms. However, most researches in this field are developed under normal scenarios (e.g. normal weather conditions). The natural disasters, such as hurricanes, on the contrary, impose hard constraints to these combinatorial problems. In this paper, a route-planning problem is solved, specifically, for the repair of electrical breakdowns that occur after natural disasters. The problem is modeled using an assignment-based integer programming formulation proposed for the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP). Moreover, this paper proposes the creative application of an algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), specifically Multi-type Ant Colony System (M-ACS), where each colony represents a set of possible global solutions. Ants cooperate and compete by means of \"frequent\" pheromone exchanges aimed to find a solution. The algorithm performance has been compared against other ACO variant, showing the efficacy of the proposed algorithm on realistic decision-making. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Computer simulation is a first logical step before taking a project to physical construction beside it is a powerful tool in energy network design. Combined systems are used to improve availability for energy supplied by renewable systems. The main inconvenient of some renewable energy sources is their highly seasonal nature, with great variations over time that can impede their use as the basis for consumption and limits them to peak demand times. The aim of this work is to simulate to verify the energetic sufficiency of a family house with renewable energies (wind, solar-photovoltaic) using a hybrid system of batteries and hydrogen. For that, Simulink\u00ae-Matlab\u00ae program was used considering meteorological data provided by CINAM (Galician Center for Environmental Research and Information). The model can be applied to determine the feasibility of implementing an energy network in specific places, and to predict energy flows and system behavior throughout the year. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of heating systems in poultry houses on the characteristics of the psychrometric air and litter quality (moisture and pH) in winter conditions in the western Santa Catarina State, Brazil. The experiment was conducted in three properties of the integrated poultry farms Perdig\u00e3o with three similar sheds, equipped with different heating systems (infrared heater -; furnace with indirect air heating; radiant experimental \"drum\" system with an infrared supplemental heating system). Values were obtained continuously from three median points of each facility at the same height of the birds - measuring the relative humidity and air temperature - for the determination of THI. For the analysis of litter humidity and litter pH, four samples were collected at four different points in each shed every two days during the period in which the heating systems were used. In the poultry houses, the THI values detected were within the range considered adequate for the development of animals in their first week, respecting the requirements of animal welfare; In their second week of life, excessive values of THI were detected, featuring discomfort and energy waste. In environments heated by the evaluated systems, the litter moisture content is maintained a suitable value according to the literature, however, the pH values of the litter samples collected in the production environments showed a basic environment, making it suitable for growth of ammonifying bacteria. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The dynamic stability of an elastic prismatic slender column with semirigid connections at both ends of identical stiffness and with sidesway between the two ends totally inhibited, subject to parametric axial loads including the combined effects of rotary inertia and external damping is investigated in a classical manner. Closed-form expressions that can be used to predict the dynamic instability regions of slender columns are developed by making use of Floquet's theory. The proposed solution is capable of capturing the phenomena of stability of columns under periodic axial loads using a single column element. The proposed method and corresponding equations can be used to investigate the effects of damping, rotary inertia and semirigid connections on the stability analysis of slender columns under periodically varying axial loads. The effects produced by shear deformations along the span of the column as well as those produced by the axial inertia, the coupling between longitudinal and transverse deflections and the curvature are not taken into account. Sensitivity studies are presented in a companion paper that show the effects of rotary inertia, damping and semirigid connections on the dynamic stability of columns under parametric axial loads. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Industrial-scale production of biopolymers is restricted by its elevated production costs in comparison with those associated with synthetic (no-biodegradable and no-biocompatible) polymers. In this study we tested for the first time two low-cost carbon substrates (i.e. carob pulp and fique juice) for lab-scale production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) with Bacillus megaterium. PHA detection and quantification was conducted by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-selected ion monitoring (GC/MS-SIM). The results suggest that PHA production using carob pulp (from Hymenaea courbaril) may be as high as with sugar cane molasses. Moreover, it could serve for the synthesis of the most commercialized type of PHA (i.e. polyhydroxybutyrate; PHB) and/or other varieties (e.g. polyhydroxy-butyrate-co-valerate; PHBV) with different properties and potential applications. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "3D modelling has been used to simulate the restoration of mining environments, mainly due to ease of use. However, this technique poorly models natural structures, such as leaves, coastlines, mountain systems, etc. Recent digital technology innovations have led to the development of fractal geometry software that reiterates geometric objects at different scales. Below we describe how this geometry can be used for environmental restoration and rehabilitation. We present a case study describing an application of fractal geometry to the restoration of a mined-out open pit. We conclude with a discussion of the advantages-mainly realism and the rapid execution time-of using this type of geometry versus 3D modelling for mining restorations. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The dynamic stability of an elastic prismatic slender column with semirigid connections at both ends of identical stiffness and with sidesway between the two ends totally inhibited, subject to parametric axial loads including the combined effects of rotary inertia and external damping was presented in a companion paper. Closed-form expressions that predict the dynamic instability regions of slender columns were developed by making use of Floquet's theory. The proposed equations are straightforward and simple to apply. The proposed solution is capable of capturing the phenomena of stability of columns under periodic axial loads using a single column element. The proposed method and corresponding equations can be used to investigate the effects of damping, rotary inertia and semirigid connections on the stability analysis of slender columns under periodically varying axial loads. Sensitivity studies are presented herein that show the effects of rotary inertia, damping and semirigid connections on the dynamic stability of columns under parametric axial loads. Analytical studies indicate that the dynamic behavior of columns under periodic loading is strongly affected by the flexural stiffness of the end connections and the external damping, but not so much by the rotary inertia. Three examples are presented in detail and the calculated results are compared with those reported by other researchers. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The tortilla is obtained by the traditional process of nixtamalization. This process has two disadvantages: production of liquid waste and it is in batches. Extrusion has resolved the problem of liquid waste, however, extrusion as of yet, has not been able to replace the traditional process of nixtamalization. This is because corn dough is a pseudoplastic fluid, which changes its viscosity in the presence of high shear velocities that occur inside the extruder. With this in mind, the following investigation proposes the mechanical design and construction of a low shear laminar transport system (LSLTS) for the production of corn dough for tortillas. This system consists of two thermally isolated stages: transport and cooking stages. The results showed that the prototype obtained meets the characteristics of homogenous cooking, low shear, absence of liquid waste and the product meets the specifications for nixtamal dough. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "It is common in the oil industry to complete horizontal wells selectively. Even, this selection is performed naturally since reservoir heterogeneity may cause segmented well performance. Segmentation may be partially open to flux due to high skin factor or low permeability bands. They can be treated as a nonuniform skin distribution. A few models have been introduced to capture these special details. Existing interpretation methodologies use non-linear regression analysis and the TDS technique; but, there is an absence of equations for the conventional technique. In this study, the conventional methodology is developed for the analysis of pressure transient tests in horizontal wells with isolated zones so directional permeabilities and skin factors can be obtained. The developed expressions were tested successfully with several examples reported in the literature and compared to results from other sources. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "One of first practical definitions for numerical solutions of classical model of Advection-Dispersion was the Elder's equation developed in 1959. This relationship based on the theoretical guidance proposed by G.I. Taylor for long, straight pipes, extent successfully the method for the case of ideal prismatic, wide channels in open flow. However, wishing to apply it to real cases with varied geometry the results were not satisfactory due to several reasons which will be examined in this article. This limiting situation for the equation is inconvenient for two reasons: First, whatsoever it is a very used equation due to its simplicity and to the fact that involve geomorphologic parameters, without requiring tracers. Secondly but not the less important, because it is based on fundamental mechanisms that are widely accepted, and then they should not lead to results in conflict with experiments. For these reasons, and also because the study of water quality depends critically on the understanding of these processes, it is interesting to review this subject. It will be tried to show if it is used a longitudinal coefficient function of time it is possible to recover the applicability of equation. For this it is used an extended work of PhD thesis done by H.B. Fischer in the Mc Keck channel of Caltech on behavior of Elder's relationship. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Amorphous carbon nitride films have been obtained by pulsed cathodic arc at substrate temperatures of 20, 100, 150 and 200 \u00b0C. Film structure was investigated by Fourier Transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. Nitrile bands at approximately 2200 cm-1 were identified in all films. As the temperature increased a reduction in the concentration of sp3 bonds and a decrease in the structure disorder were observed. The relative intensity ratio of Raman D and G bands increased as the substrate temperature increased from 20 to 100\u00b0C. Nevertheless, at a critical temperature of 150\u00b0C, this trend was broken, and the film became amorphous. A peak at approximately 1610 cm-1 of films grown at 100\u00b0C, 150\u00b0C and 200 \u00b0C suggests that CNx is dominated by a relatively ordered graphite ring like glassy carbon. Moreover, the film grown at 150 \u00b0C presented the lowest roughness and the highest hardness and hemocompatibility. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper aims to describe an alternative design (protected by patent), for an onshore wave based energy converter, specifically an oscillating water column, capable of providing increased efficiency. In order to compare the various alternative designs, a theoretical model that describes the physical behavior with certain restrictions is proposed. The converters incorporate a rectifying barrier leading to a large pool of water between the sea and the converter. In order to estimate the theoretical increase in achievable power, a theoretic cycle model is assumed for the simulation of its operational dynamics using a simplified ideal behavior: regular waves, the air assumed to be an ideal gas, with adiabatic compression and expansion. The results obtained show that a correct adjustment of the turbine differential pressure contributes to an increase in the available power output. We conclude that the proposed innovations can lead to an improved technology applicable to this type of converters. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Precipitation hardening was carried out by homogenization heat treatment of solid solutions. The microstructure analysis was carried out using optical microscope and SEM, Vickers hardness tests was also performed, tests of tensile strength and electrical conductivity, which were compared with the alloy A356-T6. The results of this research show that the increase of silver in the alloy increased tensile strength and decreases the resistivity.

The test protocols were first applied to a mechanically-ventilated broiler barn (MVB), where VR was estimated more accurately and then were used to calculate VR in the NVB. CO2 concentrations were measured with two different sampling schemes: (S1) the average of indoor measurements along the length of the building at two heights of 0.5 m and 1.5 m from the litter floor; and (S2) same as previous but with concentration measurements taken only at 0.5 m from litter. The dynamic metabolic CO2 production rate of the birds was predicted with two different algorithms: (A1) remaining constant throughout the dark and light periods, and (A2) varying with animal activity on an hourly basis. The results demonstrated that the combination of S2 with A1 or A2 yielded the best estimate of building VR in the NVB. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In pyrometallurgical processing of copper, 5-10 wt-% of concentrates fed to smelting furnaces are released in the form of flue dust, which contains most of the impurities that pollute products and effluents as well as very significant amounts of copper. Consequently, these dusts cannot be disposed of as an industrial waste and must be treated to recover the copper in order to assure efficient processing. Better process designs needs precise dust characterization. The present study is aimed at generating useful physical, chemical and morphological information of copper smelting flue dust for samples from the gas handling system of a flash smelting furnace. The analyses showed that copper and iron are mainly found in water-soluble phases like chalcantite and chalcocyanite; the water-insoluble fraction contains largely hematite and magnetite; the presence of delafossite is likely. Part of the copper detected in the insoluble fraction is also associated to iron in form of spinel. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Evaluation methods are presented to identify land use conflicts in Cesar, Colombia, due to African Palm crops. The seeding dynamics of palm are evaluated over several periods to determine if it has displaced more suitable land uses, occupied protected areas, or substituted forest ecosystems. The main intention is to resolve any doubts and corroborate declarations about the establishment of this species. The localization, extension, and growth of palm crops were determined through remote sensing and spatial analysis, as well as the land use conflicts. Recommendations are given to the scientific community and to palm growers. Although minimal, unsuitable land uses due to seeding of palm mainly present conflicts with the underutilization of moderately fertile land and the invasion of water protection areas. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents the results of a blast densification field study conducted at a waste disposal landfill located in South Carolina, United States, to determine the type of gases released and their in-situ concentrations in the ground after blast densification. The BAT probe system was used to collect groundwater and gas samples at the middle of the targeted layer and to measure the porewater pressure evolution during and after the detonation of the explosive charges. In addition, standard topographic surveys along the centerline of the tested zones were conducted after each blast event to quantify the effectiveness of the blast densification technique to densify loose sand deposits. The results of this study show that: a) the BAT probe system is a reliably in situ technique to collect groundwater and gas samples before and after blasting; b) the soil mass affected by the detonation of the explosives fully liquefied over a period of 6 hours while the in-situ vertical effective stresses returned to their initial values after about 3 days; and c) significant induced vertical strains were observed in the blasting area after each detonation, indicating that the soil mass has been successfully densified. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Sulphurs are present in different rocks. During mining activities and the sulphur removal processes Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) may be produced, by sulphate ions (SO4 2-) in solution. AMDs are the main source of pollution from mining operations and in Colombia their discharge into natural bodies of water must comply with national environmental regulations (pH between 5 and 9). Cement Kiln Dust (CKD), with calcium carbonate as its main component, from a Cementos Argos S.A. plant was used to neutralize an AMD generated through a coal bio-desulphurization process. Neutralized AMDs had pH values between 7.72-8.05 and the sulphates removal ranged from 67% to 70%. Precipitated sludge was dried and analyzed in order to determine its chemical and mineralogical composition. Moisture content was between 69% and 81%; this precipitated material was composed of gypsum with approximately 50% purity, as well as calcium carbonate. This composition makes it suitable for use in cement production. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Pedestrian systems are increasingly becoming important for transportation planning in cities, however, approaches are meant for microscopic analysis and representation, thus do not seem to be adequate for decision making at this specific strategic level, because of their feedback relationships between different levels, which cannot be easily represented with these approaches. This paper presents a prototype for analysis at strategic level of pedestrian systems, by making use of industrial dynamics. This approach allows to represent the relations of these feedback systems, through the use of both quantitative and qualitative, to analyze the responses of the system in the long run. It is concluded that the proposed prototype allows to be a support for the strategic decisions of these systems; allows analysis related to investment in education and regulation of deaths and injuries as well as their impact on the accident and the social cost. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

That is why scientific research allows us to demonstrate the use of solid state based devices implementing temperature changes by electric induction. Given the above, a combined thermic generation system is taken into consideration, consisting in an environmentally friendly thermoelectric generator and refrigerator, wich is fueled and controlled by an electric fluid. Therefore, this study gives an approch and mathematic demonstrations to the concepts of greater relevance about the thermoelectric device and the effects of greater incidence, responsible for giving advantageous characteristics to the implementation of Peltier cells as a basic device in a cooling system for smaller applications, maintaining an ecological system, clean and without detrimental effects to the ozone layer, since there is no C02 emissions into the atmosphere. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This work addresses the challenge of stimulating creative thought in higher education. With this aim in mind, the article describes the development of a collaborative creativity exercise designed to improve students' creative skills through self-perception of their strong and weak points. In this work the exercise is set out as a five-step methodology, which includes the determination of personality profiles using the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument and the design of an island, to be carried out by groups of students in the classroom. In this study, the exercise, which has been applied to first-year Technical Engineering in Industrial Design students for the last five years, is undertaken by different groups of students in five different sessions. Observations performed in the classroom and the results of the exercises, that is, both the islands that were designed and the choices made by the students, are used to draw the conclusions about the validity of the study. Moreover, the paper also compares the perceptions of the students who took part in the experiment this year and those who had done the exercise in previous years. The conclusions concern the style of working of each group of dominances, and highlight the effectiveness of the tool for enhancing students' creativity through self-reflection. The students' positive perceptions, even several years after doing the exercise, are good proof of this. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Although there have been several improvements and developments in calibration of the digital frame sensor, only limited progresses has been made in the context of multispectral image calibration. To this end, a specific photogrammetric flight was executed to try to calibrate the geometric parameters of a large format aerial digital camera. This photogrammetric flight was performed in the \"Principado de Asturias\" and it has been designed with a Ground Sample Distance of 6 cm, formed by two strips perpendicular between each other, with five images each one and a longitudinal overlap of 60%. Numerous points have been presignalled over the ground, both check points and control points. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of work was to evaluate the influence of using osmotic dehydration (OD) on drip loss (DL), volume (V), total color change (\u0394E), and firmness of Cucumis melo L. samples (Cantaloupe variety), stored under freezing conditions. The samples were dehydrated up to two humidity levels (75 and 85%, w.b.), using an osmotic sucrose solution with 55\u00b0Brix, at 27\u00b1 0.2\u00b0C. The dehydrated samples were frozen at-40\u00b0C and then stored at-18\u00b0C for 1, 15 and 30 days. Fresh fruit samples (non-osmotic treatment) were used as control duringthe frozen storage time. The results showed that the treated samples had significantly (p<0.05) lower DL, V, and \u0394E, compared to the untreated ones along the freezing process. The firmness was significantly (p<0.05) greater in treated samples. The quality of osmotictreated samples was higher than non-treated ones. However, treated samples with a lower content of humidity (75%, w.b.) showed greater firmness and lower loss in color and volume. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The best conditions to achieve an efficient adsorption were evaluated in a batch process. With an acidic pH of 2.0, a removal exceeding 90% was obtained using concentrations of AB9 of 15.0 mgL-1 and a dosage of adsorbent of 4.0 gL-1. The equilibrium of the process was modeled using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, obtaining a better fit with the latter one. Kinetic studies indicated a better fit of the process to a pseudo-second order model and negligible effect of temperature.

The proposed framework, after examining the techniques of consistency management, operates on a class diagram, since this constitutes a structural diagram. This is even more important when modeling, and it facilitates the application of rules based on the treated techniques, thus contributing to provide the community of analysts and modelers with a support tool for the refinement and quality improvement of the diagrams. It also operates on a typical case of application to show the tool's advantages, thus making it easier to comprehend and understand. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The general heuristic is adapted for unrelated parallel machines and the algorithm is implemented as a job detailed scheduling tool based on the principle of the Theory of Constraints to schedule the production based in the bottleneck resource. The adaptation of the methodology to a flexible hybrid context, where there is parallelism in the bottleneck stage, and its application in a textile plant, helps to assign capacity based on the contribution margin. The result is a viable job scheduling focused on the profitability unit. Although the results do not reach the global optimum of this type of problems, they represent a fast and effective job scheduling alternative in the contexts under study. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The use of ultrasonic guided waves is growing as a non-destructive testing technique of multi-wire cables used in civil engineering structures. Wave propagation characteristics in these types of structures have been challenging to investigate owing to the load-dependent inter-wire contact and the helical geometry of the peripheral wires. In this work, experiments of guided waves propagated in a 0.9m Aluminum Conductor Steel Reinforced (ACSR) cable were conducted employing two longitudinal piezoelectric transducers attached to the ends of the cable in a through transmission configuration. Longitudinal L(0,1) and flexural F(1,1) modes were identified at 500 kHz via dispersion curves and Wavelet Transforms (WT). Experiments included artificial damage introduced in the middle of the cable by cutting and gradually increasing the cut depth from 1mm to 9mm. The attained results suggest a change of guided modes excitation and reception from F(1,1) to L(0,1) due to reduced friction contact among individual wires. This change of guided waves modes in response to damage variations, associated with the transmitted ultrasonic energy, was identified and discussed as potential mean of damage monitoring. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The wealth of data recorded by meteorological networks provides a great opportunity for analyzing and discovering knowledge. However, efficient data storage and its effective handling are prerequisites for meteorological and hydro-climatological research and require strategies for capturing, delivering, storing and processing that guarantee quality and consistency of the data. The purpose of this work is to develop a conceptual model for a data warehouse in a star schema that allows the structured storage and multidimensional analysis of historical hydro-climatological data. Information registered by two telemetered networks of hydro-meteorological stations has been collected in the city of Manizales, Colombia. From the designed data warehouse schema, the data warehouse exploits the data (in some cases extending back more than 50 years) in order to apply online analytical processing (OLAP) techniques and discovery potential high-value hidden relationships, in a region particularly affected by climate change and climate variability phenomena. The core contribution of this paper encompasses the exploration of alternatives to the traditional storage and analysis methods and the presentation of a number of cases, showing the effectiveness of the proposed model in the evaluation of the data quality and the visualization of relationships among diverse variables in different scales and for specific cases. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This plume could have a very restricted area of impact because the dispersion is only controlled by the ocean currents which, at 1000 m depth, have a low intensity and are quite turbulent. In this case, the formed plume stayed trapped at 1000 m depth, not posing a risk to the Caribbean Coast. In contrast, droplets with diameters of 250 \u03bcm, 1 and 10mm rose rapidly to the surface, even with different velocities (6, 10, 20 ms-1). \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In this article, a joint Radio Access Network selection strategy and a sub-channel resource allocation scheme are introduced, in which the downlink of a two-tier HetNet system is deployed in a co-channel deployment. With this scenario in mind, a Semi Markovian Decision Process based-model is proposed to find an optimal policy for user association and the channel allocation, where the long-term expected reward is maximized. For the proposed strategy, the sub-channel allocation is only considered for those new and handoff petitions that potentially can be allocated in one of the SCs. In addition, with the aim of contributing to the enhancement of the overall usage of radio resources, a traffic offloading process is considered at the departure of the sessions. In order to motivate the session offloading from the MC to the SCs at departure times, we have defined that two sub-channels will be allocated in the SC for each offloaded session. Analytical results quantify and show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Hot compression tests are performed when jaws, each one with a jacketed section to cool a part of its length, move through a tube furnace at elevated temperatures to compress a metal sample between them, changing the boundary conditions and the temperature distribution inside the furnace during the test. This paper presents a preliminary study about the variation of temperature inside a furnace for hot compression tests, when the jaws are positioned inside it. It also proposes a theoretical simulation to determine the temperature profile in the furnace, which is compared with experimental measurements. Both experimental measurement and simulation showed that the temperature inside the tube furnace for hot compression tests is not uniform. By comparing the simulated values with experimental measurements, it can be concluded that the simulation proposed in this paper is a useful tool which estimates the temperature inside a tube furnace in hot compression tests with an acceptable approximation (error less than 4.73%). \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The historical monthly precipitation fields in Colombia are estimated and studied for the period 1975-2006 at a spatial resolution of 5 minutes of arc, calculated using an optimal integration of information available at rain gauges and distributed monthly series of fields from satellite measurements and studies of reanalysis at different periods and various spatial resolutions. Space interpolation of point observations uses a variant of the PRISM model [1]. Based on a MDT, the relationship between precipitation and topography was studied, allowing the development and implementation of a model of interpolation similar to PRISM to estimate monthly precipitation fields. Considering the topographic effect as the most important factor in explaining the spatial variability of rainfall, the study area is discretized in homogeneous regions that allowed to represent adequately the presence of the pluviometric optimal height and the temporal variability imposed by the ITCZ. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "This paper reports the main results of a thermodynamic study realized on the use of a low temperature heat source (150\u00b0C as maximum) for power generation through a subcritical Rankine power cycle with R134a as working fluid. The procedure for analyzing the behavior of the proposed cycle consisted of modifying the input pressure, temperature and/or discharge pressure of the turbine with working fluid at conditions of both saturation and overheating. Results show that the efficiency of the cycle for this fluid is a weak function of temperature, i.e., overheating the inlet fluid to the turbine does not cause a significant change in the efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio in the turbine increases, it is much more efficient, and also, as the input temperature to the turbine rises, the efficiency increases more sharply. Furthermore, the effect of adding an internal heat exchanger to the cycle was analyzed, giving as a result a maximum efficiency of 11% and 14% for the basic cycle and with an internal heat exchanger, respectively. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) shows the relationship between the size of the heart and the size of the chest. The proposed scheme uses a robust fuzzy classifier to find the correct feature values of chest size, and the right and left heart boundaries to measure the heart enlargement to detect cardiomegaly. The proposed approach uses classical morphology operations to segment the lungs providing low computational complexity and the proposed fuzzy method is robust to find the correct measures of CTR providing a fast computation because the fuzzy rules use elementary arithmetic operations to perform a good detection of cardiomegaly. Finally, we improve the classification results of the proposed fuzzy method using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Likewise, the transformation of this type of problem (i.e. solving a system of equations) into an optimization one is also shown. The current algorithm is able to find all the integer roots in a given search domain, at least for the examples shown. Simple problems are used to show its efficacy. Moreover, aspects related to the processing time, as well as to the effect of increasing the population and the search space, are discussed. It was found that the strategy shown herein represents a good approach when dealing with systems that have more unknowns than equations, or when it becomes of considerable size, since a big search domain is required. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This is based on the belief-based goal processing model proposed by Castelfranchi and Paglieri, which is a more expressive and refined model than the BDI (Beliefs-Desires-Intentions) model. We focus on the progress of goals since they are desires until they become intentions, including the conditions under which a goal can be cancelled. We use argumentation to support the passage of the goals from their initial state until their final state. Our proposal complies with the properties defined by Castelfranchi and Paglieri, diachrony and synchrony. The first means that the support is given since the goal is a desire until it becomes an intention, and the second means that the support can be tracked, i.e. there is a memory of the cognitive path from the beginning of the process until the end. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

Such activity is intended to allow for an initial requirements definition and the fulfillment of the stakeholder needs. Such problems can be directly traced to the organizational goals for achieving contextualized software applications and alignment with the organizational raison d'etre. In current elicitation methods based on goals and problems, the relationships are detected by the analyst and the stakeholder by using his/her experience and knowledge. However, traceability among goals and problems is still not achieved. In this paper we propose a method for specifying problems based on business goals.

    "Abstract": "Phase transformations in air plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings composed of ZrO2-8 wt.% Y2O3 (zirconia-8 wt.% yttria) are studied using X-Ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement measurements. Samples of TBC deposited onto Inconel 625 substrate were fabricated and heat treated at two different conditions: exposition to 1100\u00b0C up to 1000 hours and exposition to temperatures between 700\u00b0C and 1100\u00b0C during 50 hours. According to Rietveld refinement measurements, the content of the cubic phase in the top coat increases with time and temperature; it starts at 7.3 wt.% and reaches 15.7 wt.% after 1000 hours at 1100\u00b0C. The presence of a cubic phase in high amounts is undesirable due its lower mechanical properties compared with the tetragonal phase. After 800 hours of exposure to high temperature, the amount of Y2O3 in the tetragonal phase reduces to 6.6 wt.% and a fraction of this phase transforms to a monoclinic structure during cooling. The monoclinic phase reached 18.0 wt.% after 1000 hours. This phase is also undesirable, not only due to its higher thermal conductivity, but also because the tetragonal-to-monoclinic transformation implies a volume change of circa 5%, which favors crack formation and propagation and compromises the coating integrity. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "UV-visible spectrometers are instruments that register the absorbance of emitted light by particles suspended in water for several wavelengths and deliver continuous measurements that can be interpreted as concentrations of parameters commonly used to evaluate physico-chemical status of water bodies. Classical parameters that indicate presence of pollutants are total suspended solids (TSS) and chemical demand of oxygen (CDO). Flexible and efficient methods to relate the instruments's multivariate registers and classical measurements are needed in order to extract useful information for management and monitoring. Analysis methods such as Partial Least Squares (PLS) are used in order to calibrate an instrument for a water matrix taking into account cross-sensitivity. Several authors have shown that it is necessary to undertake specific instrument calibrations for the studied hydro-system and explore linear and non-linear statistical methods for the UV-visible data analysis and its relationship with chemical and physical parameters. In this work we apply classical linear multivariate data analysis and nonlinear kernel methods in order to mine UV-vis high dimensional data, which turn out to be useful for detecting relationships between UV-vis data and classical parameters and outliers, as well as revealing non-linear data structures. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

To collect the information, 120 surveys were applied to companies, and to obtain a causal with structural equation modelling to explain those effects, a methodology of partial least squares was used with WarpPls 3.0\u00ae. The results indicate that a good level in the regional infrastructure has a positive impact on logistics services, and as a consequence in the costs. Also, the regional infrastructure has a positive impact on time delivery of products. Regarding the level of infrastructure (transport, telecommunications, and internet) and services (air, land, financial, legal) in Ciudad Juarez, respondents are considering that it is good, so the product deliveries are complete on time in the past 3 years. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Acid mine drainage (AMD) from mining wastes is one of the current environmental problems in the field of mining pollution that requires most action measures. This term describes the drainage generated by natural oxidation of sulfide minerals when they are exposed to the combined action of water and atmospheric oxygen. AMD is characterized by acidic effluents with a high content of sulfate and heavy metal ions in solution, which can contaminate both groundwater and surface water. Minerals responsible for AMD generation are iron sulfides (pyrite, FeS2, and to a lesser extent pyrrhotite, Fe1-XS), which are stable and insoluble while not in contact with water and atmospheric oxygen. However, as a result of mining activities, both sulfides are exposed to oxidizing ambient conditions. In order to prevent AMD formation, a great number of extensive research studies have been devoted to the mechanisms of oxidation and its prevention. In this work, we present an explanation and theoretical valuation of the pyrite oxidation process and a compendium on the measures most frequently employed for its prevention and correction. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "We developed a monolateral external fixation system for bone lengthening that is easier to assemble than commercial systems. In this system, the clamps can be laterally assembled to the rail in contrast to the commercial systems in which the clamps can only be assembled from the ends. The system is formed by clamps, screws, and a rail. The rail is composed of two carbon fiber circular rods of \u00bd\u201d diameter and 42 cm length. The clamps can slide with respect to the rail to allow bone distraction or may be fixed to the rail by using a wedge and a screw. The prototype was mechanically evaluated under the ASTM F1541 standard. The stiffness in axial loading, medio-lateral bending (ML), antero-posterior bending (AP), and flexo-torsional loading were 117 N/mm, 46 N/mm, 8.7 N/mm, and 5.8 N-mm/\u00b0, respectively, which are in the range of the stiffness of commercial systems. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

In this kind of crops is very important the use of advanced techniques and new technologies to improve the crop efficiency. This work presents an advanced system to monitor the variables applied on greenhouse crops. The monitoring system uses a wireless sensor network (WSN) that works with 6LoWPAN and RPL as the routing protocol. It measures humidity, temperature, light, and volumetric water content in the soil. The WSN sends the recollected data to an embedded device which stores the information on a data base, so it is possible to visualize in real time the values obtained of crops as a graphic. The developed system allows installation flexibility and adaptation to any greenhouse. Because it is based on: Wireless technology, nodes can establish links automatically, and have implemented a function for saving energy which can extend the life of the batteries enough for a crop year without maintenance. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

This model provides alternative solutions that may be compared to the other ones initially known.

    "Abstract": "After the power void caused by the Roman Empire's decline, Medieval Europe is involved in a combat climate for the power. The new Christian church from Rome expands and includes kings and emperors. The Christian pope seeks to compel all believers to subscribe the closed religious perspective of that time. However it is religious people who recognize the necessity to observe nature and the world in a different way. The discovery, translation and diffusion of the classic Greek philosophers' texts allow the initiation of independent thinking, which in turn, spurs the Renaissance and Illustration ages. The inductive thinking method begins with the purpose of finding other ways to interpret nature and advance the thought process. Therefore during the XVI century alchemy is questioned and the first treatises on empirical metallurgy appear, considered to be the foundations of modern science. During the XVII century some individuals begin experimenting with residual alchemical concepts. The first hypotheses on key chemical concepts and phenomena appear which frame the logic and rational thought process during the XVIII century. The concept of affinity emerges as a way to describe the relations among substances, observed during the formation of compounds, and as an analogy to human relations. Published works regarding the components of the thinking process consolidate the basic concepts of chemical bonding and related themes. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "In the current study the SWAT hydrological simulation model was implemented in the sub basin Los Pozos, located in the Aquitania municipality, department of Boyac\u00e1, Colombia, in order to quantify the effect caused by changes from plant cover in the hydrological response. The affordmentioned was evaluated in recovery scenarios, which were formulated taking into account the territory planning instruments, and scenarios the agricultural expansion frontiers. The model was manually calibrated and validated to improve its prediction capacity by means of the coefficient of R2 determination, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index and percentage bias (Percent Bias-PBIAS), making the sensitivity analysis previously, which facilitated the calibration process. Once the model hydrologically represented the subbasin the scenarios were created, allowing identifying the handling in terms of plant cover that can be implemented to favor water regulation. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The Institutional Repositories (IR) have been consolidated into the academy, the proof of this is the growth in number of records in existing directories made by various means, such as self-archiving by authors and the incorporation of material by librarians. In this paper, a bibliographic survey about the use of the Model-Driven Software Development approach is done (MDD) in the IR systems in order to establish a relationship between them. The MDD is a paradigm for building software that assigns a central role to the models and originates models that range from the most abstract to the most concrete. This paradigm also provides a framework that allows the interested ones to share their points of view and directly manipulate the representations of the domain entities from IR. In conclusion, the monitoring of the various researches, and what is expressed here, allow to encourage the implementation of software for IR. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Innovation is a key competitive input for firms and countries and there are well-established models for analyzing the innovation process at the national and regional level. Although we have an abundant literature on industrial districts and innovative agglomerations, there are few case studies that go beyond the description and empirically check the existence of a local innovation system. Hence, in this paper we will discuss a successful experience in innovation, The Knowledge Mile of Gij\u00f3n, placed at the North of Spain, in order to determine whether the different agents are articulated and interact as a real local innovation system. Using the network analysis technique, we will provide confirmatory evidence showing that (i) relations among agents are dense, cohesive and well-connected and (ii) innovation-support organizations play an important role in the system. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Land availability is an essential prerequisite for providing housing solutions; however, access to this soil faces administrative, regulatory and technical obstacles that cause chaotic urbanization processes in the main cities of the country. This article discusses management tools for soil availability in current legislation and used in projects developed by Metrovivienda in Bogot\u00e1 D.C. As a result, we found that the main issues are: scarcity and high land prices and the persistent phenomenon of illegal urbanization aim to meet the unsatisfied demand, especially for people in informal labor market. Currently Public Housing Policy focuses primarily on subsidies to demand allocation and implementation of housing construction projects, but it is necessary the articulation of this Policy with a Public Land Policy that regulates use and land market. Otherwise, a long-term planning and will be very difficult to reduce the gap between supply and demand for housing and achieve an efficient, equitable and orderly development for the city. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "One of the most important uses of artificial neural networks is to forecast non-linear time series, although model-building issues, such as input selection, model complexity and parameters estimation, remain without a satisfactory solution. More of research efforts are devoted to solve these issues. However, other models emerged from statistics would be more appropriated than neural networks for forecasting, in the sense that the process of model specification is based entirely on statistical criteria. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is a statistical model commonly used for solving nonlinear regression problems, and it is possible to use it for forecasting time series. Nonetheless, there is a lack of studies comparing the results obtained using MARS and neural network models, with the aim of determinate which model is better. In this paper, we forecast four nonlinear time series using MARS and we compare the obtained results against the reported results in the technical literature when artificial neural networks and the ARIMA approach are used. The main finding in this research, it is that for all considered cases, the forecasts obtained with MARS are lower in accuracy in relation to the other approaches. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Porcine specimens have proven to be an excellent option for experimental studies of the spine, due to the anatomically and biomechanically similarities with that of the human; however, there are differences that should be taken into account when comparing both specimens. The objective of this study is to determine the stiffness coefficient of the L3-L4 lumbar porcine segment by means of axial compression tests performed on Anterior Column Units (ACU's) and Functional Spinal Units (FSU's), in order to compare the results obtained with the information found in the literature for the human case. The results showed that the FSU's support approximately 22% more load compared to ACU's, which approximates to the 18% found for the human case. It can be concluded that characteristics such as the vertebrae morphometry has a direct impact on the mechanical properties of the ACU's and the FSU's. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The efficiency of the method in removing E. coli, B. subtilis, E. faecalis and S. typhimurium was determined using PET bottles with sterile distilled water and an initial concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 UFC/ml of each microorganism. For SODIS+A. annua a 10% (v/v) infusion of A. annua was added; the bottles were exposed to sunlight for at least 6 hours and three variables (water temperature, solar radiation and turbidity) were measured. It was found that SODIS treatment was more efficient in the removal of the four microorganisms than SODIS + A. annua. The removals were higher after four hours of exposure to the bacterial species in their vegetative state. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The experiments were conducted at hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 days in the first stage (acidifier) and at HRT of 11.5, 15, 18 and 20 days in the second stage (methanizer). The results revealed that the HRT had a high influence on the soluble chemical oxygen demand (CODs) and total dissolved solids (TDS) removal. The maximum total CODs removal efficiency of 86.4% and TDS removal efficiency of 81.9% was achieved at 20 days of global HRT. The maximum biogas production of 0.65 m3 per kilogramme of volatile dissolved solids (VDS) removed (65% CH4) was also achieved at 20 days of HRT. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The research encompassed phases of diagnosis, intervention and evaluation. A comparative analysis between the companies was conducted: energy consumption versus product volume, energy-quality analysis, relation between compliance/specific energy consumption, and the impact on CO2 emissions. Results revealed that the acceptance to the recommendations of savings is biased by the level of investments and the willing/proneness of the administration. The study showed that interventions had a partial effect on the reduction of the specific energy consumption in 4 companies. In addition, it has obtained a positive effect on the power factor correction in one company and an improvement on the load balance in 5.

In this study, some characteristics of the physical behavior of the macroemulsion with astaxanthin oleoresin that are in close relationship with stability were determined. One of them was the viscosity at 5, 10, 20 and 30\u00b0C. Another, corresponded to observing the size variation of the micelles, observed under the microscope for 8 days and finally, the color was determined in CIEL*a*b* system for 34 days. The results showed that the macroemulsion behaved like a shear thinning fluid up to 20\u00b0C, becoming a shear thickening fluid at 30\u00b0 C. In addition, the macroemulsion presented stability in the color as time elapsed; observing some slight variations that may be due to flocculation and coalescence. Both affect the viscosity at low temperatures. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

For this purpose, 10 solid solutions were obtained by means of casting and mechanical alloying. The microstructural characterization was carried out by means of X ray diffraction. The lattice parameter was obtained using the Rietveld's method, while the chemical composition was determined by dispersive energy X-ray spectroscopy. Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that there is an inverse lineal relationship between the atomic volume of the solid solution and its Zn concentration, which shows a negative deviation from Vegard's law (-2.96%). Additionally, it was proposed an equation which relates the Zn concentration with the atomic volume of the solid solution, which showed a prediction error less than 12%. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Due to the multiple applications that kaolin has, including the ceramic industry where it is used as a slurry with high solid concentrations, its rheological behavior is quite important in mixing, agitation and pumping stages. After characterizing the kaolin by applying XRD, XRF, SEM and particle size methods, a rheological evaluation was performed in a rotational rheometer which consisted of measuring the primary normal stress difference N1 by a method that delivered good reproducibility results. With N1 data it was obtained a kind of viscosity known as dilatant viscosity which was found only for those suspensions with a volumetric concentration higher than 0.13. This dilatant viscosity depends on the shear rate and the CV, and it was modeled with the power law structure having good coefficients of determination. Finally it was found that the dilatant viscosity with a CV= 0.2 is almost five times the value of the shear viscosity, thus demonstrating that for a better understanding of the deformation stage must be taken into account the normal stresses in shear flow happening in the kaolin concentrated suspension. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "The analysis of connections between elements of glued laminated pressed bamboo guadua (Guadua angustifolia Kunth) for a housing project is presented in this article. The analysis was carried out in four stages: design, load test, numerical simulation and finite element modeling. Design connection was developed using the allowable stresses method. In load test, displacements were measured in order to identify the behavior of connections for different load increments. Numerical simulation was performed in the software ETABS\u00ae with the loads used in the load test in order to determine the displacements at points experimentally instrumented in the test; each stage of load of test was simulated. Finally, the finite element modeling was performed in the software ANSYS\u00ae. Differences between the experimental results and those obtained with the simulations were found, which could be result of the differences between real conditions of the load test and design considerations as behavior completely rigid or pinned of connections. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "During the last several decades, stronger and lighter materials have been developed with the aim of optimizing performance and building costs. These technological advances have given rise to thin flexible flooring systems with natural frequencies that lie within the frequency range of vibrations produced by human activity. Human occupants can cause changes in the dynamic properties of the structure and structural vibrations can cause discomfort to the occupants, who not only perceive the vibrations but also interact dynamically with the structure. This paper presents the results of the characterization of the effect of human-structure interaction (HSI) in three flooring systems commonly used in the Colombian building industry. The methodology consisted in the characterization of the dynamic response of the flooring systems due to different coordinated human activities. Based on the results, the authors recommend that future building codes account for human-structure interaction effects in flooring systems. \u00a9 The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Laminated composites are widely used in applications when a high strength-to-weight ratio is required. Aeronautic, naval and automotive industries use these materials to reduce the weight of the vehicles and, consequently, fuel consumption. However, the fiber-reinforced laminated materials are anisotropic and the elastic properties can vary widely due to non-standardized manufacturing processes. The elastic characterization using mechanical tests is not easy, destructive and, in most cases, not all the elastic constants can be obtained. Therefore, alternative techniques are required to assure the quality of the mechanical parts and the evaluation of new materials. In this work, the implementation of the ultrasonic through-transmission technique and the characterization of some engineering materials is reported. Isotropic materials and laminated composites of carbon fiber and glass fiber in a polymer matrix were characterized by ultrasound and mechanical tests. An improved methodology for the transit time delay calculation is reported. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "A robust medical image processing system depends upon a variety of aspects, including a proper image enhancement, and an optimal segmentation. An algorithm was proposed in this paper to facilitate the implementation of these two steps. First a Magnetic Resonance (MR) image is enhanced via spatial domain filtering and its contrast is improved, next, the image is segmented using fuzzy C-mean clustering, then the region of interest which might be the tumor or edema, is detected and delineated. The key advantage of this image processing pipeline is the simultaneous use of features computed from the intensity properties of the image in a cascading pattern which makes the computation self-contained. Performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm was carried out on brain images from different MRI's and the algorithm proved to be successful, comparing it with other dedicated applications.",

    "Abstract": "Densifcation and shrinkage behaviour of ceramics or other powder materials can be predicted in a simple manner by using the master sintering curve. In this work, the densifcation data required to construct the master sintering curve of a 3-mol% yttria stabilised zirconia powder have been obtained. Bulk samples prepared by cold pressing, as well as thick flms made of the same powder applied to a rigid substrate, were sintered. The free and constrained sintering experiments have been performed applying three different heating rates, with and without isothermal step at a maximum temperature of about 1450 \u00b0C. The shrinkage of the samples was measured in situ during densifcation using a push rod dilatometer. Also, a conventional box furnace was used, applying the same heating schedule, to compare the results. Microstructural analysis has been achieved by using scanning electron microscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy, and optical microscopy. An acceptable agreement was obtained between similar samples sintered in the dilatometer and the box furnace, indicating that the dilatometer data could be used for both environments. The bulk samples reached lower densities than the flms, probably due to their lower initial densities. For the samples free of constraint, a master sintering curve was achieved with an activation energy of 550 kJ mol-1. For the constrained case, problems associated with the substrate and the uncertainties in the measurements hindered the characterisation of the flm, i.e., a single master sintering curve could not be produced.",

    "Abstract": "This paper deals with the reliable and efficient numerical identification of parameters defining the flux function and the diffusion coefficient of a strongly degenerate parabolic partial differential equation (PDE), which is the basis of a mathematical model for sedimentation-consolidation processes. A zero-flux initial-boundary value problem (IBVP) posed for this PDE describes the settling of a suspension in a column. The parameters for a given material are estimated by the repeated numerical solutions of the IBVP (direct problem) under systematic variation of the model parameters, with the aim of successively minimizing a cost functional that measures the distance between a space-dependent observation and the corresponding numerical solution. Two important features of this paper are the following. In the first place, the method proposed for the efficient and accurate numerical solution of the direct problem. We implement a well-known explicit, monotone three-point finite difference scheme enhanced by discrete mollification. The mollified scheme occupies a larger stencil but converges under a less restrictive CFL condition, which allows the use of a larger time step. The second feature is the thorough sensitivity and stability analysis of the parametric model functions that play the roles of initial guess and observation data, respectively.",

A part of the synthesized material was impregnated with phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40) in order to evaluate the effect of this dopant agent on the thermal, textural and structural properties of zirconium oxide (ZrO2). Pure and modified hydroxides were calcined in an air fow at 400, 500 and 600\u00b0C for 3 h and afterwards were characterized by thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and nitrogen physisorption. Results showed that the interaction between the heteropolyanion and zirconium oxide surface produces a stabilizing effect of the crystalline structure and delays the drastic sintering of the material caused by the thermal treatment, obtaining high specific surface areas and small crystallite size for the modified zirconium oxides.",

    "Abstract": "One of the most common road pavement pathologies is caused by water action. The presence of moisture causes a reduction in aggregate-binder adhesion in the mix as well as in the internal cohesion of the bitumen. This leads to problems such as pot holes, aggregate peeling, stripping, etc., which eventually lead to the structural failure of the pavement. Currently, there are numerous laboratory tests that analyze the susceptibility of bituminous mixes to moisture, providing a qualitative or quantitative evaluation. This study analyzes the performance of bituminous mixes in different experimental conditions. For this purpose, a comparative study of two laboratory tests was carried out. The tests differed in mix compaction method, the conditioning of the test specimens, and the type of load applied. The results obtained showed that in these tests the conditioning temperature had a greater impact on mix performance than the temporal duration of the conditioning process. Furthermore, the application of tensile stress was found to be more suitable for studying moisture susceptibility since mixes were found to be more sensitive to this type of load.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents the performance of seventeen rigid pavements made of Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) located in the State of Ohio, USA. The Falling Weight Defectlometer (FWD) testing method was used in a total of 58 km of PCC pavement sections to assess the pavement structural condition. Each section is classified as excellent, good, fair, or poor based on the normalized defections obtained from FWD tests, spread ability, load transfer, and joint support ratio parameters. The overall performance of the analyzed sections is from good to excellent. The field testing methodology along with the performance data analyses presented in this publication are a valuable tool to evaluate the actual structural condition of pavements and as a result short or medium term rehabilitation programs can be issued to ensure the serviceability of the pavement.",

In this study, mechanical tests, metallographic analysis and morphological study were carried out. We determined that the levels of discoloration in the HAZ are directly influenced by the amount of atmospheric oxygen present in the purge, with amounts between 50 to 10 ppm the discoloration is according to AWS D18.1 and AWS D18. 2 standards. While was evidenced good resistance in the welded joint because the failure occurs in the base metal and not in the HAZ which has not influence of surface discoloration corresponding to 10 ppm. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

The typical parameters of pore resistance and charge transfer resistance were determined employing an equivalent electric circuit. Constant phase elements (CPE) were used in order to determine fraction of water absorbed, mass diffusion, solubility and the swelling coefficients, as well as to predict the failure times of the coating. The results found by EIS measurements match very well with the high resistance to deterioration exhibited by the coating. It was also found that the excellent protection performance of the coating was mainly due to low water solubility and low permeability.",

    "Abstract": "Feature Models (FMs) are a notation to represent differences and commonalities between products derived from a product line. However, product line modelers could unintentionally incorporate dead features in FMs. A dead feature is a type of defect, which implies that one or more features are not present in any product of the product line. Some authors have used ontologies in product lines, but they have not exploited ontology reasoning to identify and explain causes for defects in FMs in natural language. In this paper, we propose an ontology that represents FMs in OWL (Web Ontology Language). Then, we use SQWRL (Semantic Query-enhanced Web Rule Language) to identify dead features in a FM and identify and explain certain causes of this defect in natural language. Our preliminary empirical evaluation confrms the benefts of our approach.",

ICT have become a key element for business development and the improvement of activities in all departments. Analogously, the rise of Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS), Condition Based Maintenance (CBM), and the use of remote devices and functions such as e-maintenance, have opened great possibilities for maintenance optimization. Those techniques have resulted in the emergence of technological challenges such as interoperability between different systems in order to exchange and coordinate information. In this context, the application of business process modeling is a crucial methodology to understand and implement those maintenance techniques. In this paper, we use business process modeling approach to design a system architecture that integrates CMMS, CBM and e-maintenance methods, tools, and processes.

Sinter is subjected to in-depth characterisation in terms of chemical and granulometric analysis, determination of the mineral phases in its structure and of quality indices such as reducibility, low temperature degradation, reduction degradation, and tumbler strength. It is also important to operate sinter plants with high productivity and to ensure a uniform sinter composition and quality so as to facilitate the steady state operation of the blast furnace.",

Samples of Ba2ZrTiO6 were synthesized through the standard solid state reaction method. The crystalline structure was studied by means of X-ray diffraction experiments and Rietveld-like analysis. Results reveal that the material crystallizes in a rhomboidal structure, space group R-3 (#148), with cell parameter a=5.8038(7) \u00c5. The ferroelectric response of material was established from curves of polarization as a function of applied electric field. Our results reveal that the double perovskite Ba2ZrTiO6 has a ferroelectric hysteretic behavior at room temperature. The studies of the electronic structure show that Ba2ZrTiO6 behaves as a nonmetallic material with gap energy 2.32 eV. The structural parameters obtained from energy minimization, through the Murnaghan equation state are 99.5% in agreement with the experimental data.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this research was to determine the influence of certain variables (e.g., collector addition, pulp dilution, conditioning times, pH and pulp agitation speed) on the yield for feldspar sand flotation aimed at separating quartz from feldspar and to estimate the values that provide an optimum yield. The feldspathic sands were obtained from a sedimentary deposit located in the Sarreaus region (Ourense province, NW Spain). Flotation yield was based on two parameters: grade and recovery. Each of these parameters was determined in a series of experiments in which a single parameter was varied at a time while the remainder were kept constant. The results indicate that it is possible to obtain a high flotation yield using optimum process variables. With these optimum variables, the average concentrate grade and recovery were 95.1% and 25.6%, respectively.",

The model includes electro migration, electro osmosis, ordinary diffusion, and convection transport mechanisms, it assumes local chemical equilibrium and unsteady state conditions. An artificially contaminated soil from Canine, Mexico was used as an example. The model predictions were compared with experimental data collected in a laboratory, circular-shaped soil in which a central anode and four cathodes in the periphery were inserted.

Overall, the larger the electrical potential applied between electrodes, the shorter the time to achieve steady state.

Mixtures of natural gas received in Antioquia (Colombia) between 2011-2015 were studied. High heating value of the mixtures were obtained by descriptive statistic. Interchangeability-related properties were calculated using the GRIMECH 3.0 mechanism. Laminar burning velocity was calculated by numerical simulation and measured using the Schlieren technique. Indexes of interchangeability were validated experimentally and it was found that the interchangeability does not exceed 5.5% compared to the base gas. Therefore, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to adjust the designs of the thermal devices when the mixtures are used. \u00a9 The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.",

    "Abstract": "Dynamic security assessment (DSA) is defined as the ability of a power system to withstand sudden contingencies and to survive the transient and to reach an acceptable steady-state condition. During system operation, the on-line assessment of the dynamic security level is essential in order to take adequate countermeasures aimed to restore the system, if necessary, to a more secure operating condition. Due to both the great complexity of latest power systems and the large number of components, the on-line DSA leads to excessive computational complexity which makes it not fully operational, particularly with the inclusion of complex emerging grid-tied AC micro grids. To overcome this problem, a new approach of on-line DSA of micro grids is presented in this paper. The proposal employs distributed processing and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in order to reduce the computing times; thus allowing its execution on-line.",

    "Abstract": "Feature selection is a preprocessing technique with the objective of finding a subset of attributes that improve the classifier performance. In this paper, a new algorithm (IRBASIRRED) is presented for the generation of learning rules that uses feature selection to obtain the knowledge model. Also a new method (REDUCTSIM) is presented for the reduct's calculation using the optimization technique, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The proposed algorithm was tested on data sets from the UCI Repository and compared with the algorithms: C4.5, LEM2, MODLEM, EXPLORE and IRBASIR. The results obtained showed that IRBASIRRED is a method that generates classification rules using subsets of attributes, obtaining better results than the algorithm where all attributes are used.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of sample thickness (2, 3 and 4 mm) on the drying kinetics, water activity (aw) and color (\u0394E) of papaya puree slices processed through Refractance Window\u2122 technology (RW\u2122). Additionally, the water diffusion coefficient (Deff) was evaluated taking into account the shrinkage effect. The experimental values of moisture were fitted using Newton's and Midilli's models. The results showed that the lower the thickness, the faster the drying, the lower the values of aw and the higher the \u0394E. The samples reached 0.0652, 0.1132 and 0.2624 g water/ g dry solid in 60 min for 2, 3 and 4 mm slices, respectively. Midilli's model was the most appropriate to predict the experimental curves of papaya drying through RW\u2122. Deff decreased at a lower thickness and its order of magnitude was of 10-10 m2/s.",

    "Abstract": "An extended analysis and the experimental validation of a mathematical model for Total Cross-Tied photovoltaic arrays, based on the inflection points concept, is presented. The model is able to reproduce the electrical characteristics of real photovoltaic plants in both uniform and mismatched conditions (e.g. partial shading). The model calculates the array voltages in which the bypass diodes are turned on, which allows one to detect when a photovoltaic module is active or bypassed in order to consider or neglect its contribution to the array current and power. Such a procedure generates a significant reduction in the computational burden required in comparison with classical approaches. The experiments presented in this paper confirm the advantages of the model: Low computational burden, high accuracy reproducing the experimental data, and its usefulness to perform energetic evaluations for viability analysis.",

    "Abstract": "Due to the high rates of consumption of minerals and the high human population growth, mineral resources on planet Earth are in the process of exhaustion, this shortage creates the need to find new alternatives to supply the growing needs. An additional alternative to the traditional search for new deposits on Earth, is the search for deposits beyond our planet, these new resources can be found in the vicinity of our planet. The mining of bodies of our solar system like the Moon, Mars and the asteroid belt can provide abundant energy resources such as helium 3 and minerals such as potassium, rare earth elements, iron and platinum group minerals. Now some companies are planning this exploration and for geologists and mining professionals in general, it has considerable potential for scientific research, technological innovation and professional development in new fields.",

    "Abstract": "Herein, we introduce a new thermal contrast enhancement procedure for infrared images, acquired from a non-destructive evaluation of composite slabs through active infrared thermography experiments. This technique can compensate for the vignetting effect, as well as the non-uniform heating produced by the thermal excitation scheme. The proposed technique does not depend on any heat propagation model but almost exclusively on experimental data, because it is based on an unsharp mask operation using a median filter. The preliminary results show that real and apparent non-uniform heating is effectively compensated with this method, resulting in better images of possible internal defects than other classic methods like Differential Absolute Contrast (DAC), and therefore increasing the probability of more efficient detection and characterization procedures; specifically, the non-uniformity effect on the original sequence could be reduced by about 74%, according to a non-uniformity parameter defined in this work, as well.",

    "Abstract": "During melting, reduction or thermal treatment of a steel charge, the input of energy (either chemical or electrical) is indispensable to guarantee the viability of the process. Under these circumstances, it will be reasonable to design the furnace lining in such a way that heat loss through the walls is minimized. Nevertheless, it can be proved that, for some situations, it is more efficient to withdraw as much heat as possible from the walls than trying to thermally isolate the system. The work presents recommendations for the design of walls and cooling systems in furnaces obtained by quantitative analysis of temperatures reached in specific locations of the furnace using the nodal wear model. The analysis indicates that the wear process of the lining may be controlled if all the elements that intervene in the process are known.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper a procedure based on the Finite Element Method and Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics to obtain a mathematical model of crack propagation in transverse fillet welded joints is presented. We used ASTM-A36 steel plates and E6013 electrodes for the joints, using shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) as the welding process. The model uses a surface crack located in the weld toe. Differences of up to 41% in crack growth rates were found between cracks located 90% out of the bead mid plane with respect to the central crack. The straight and convex bead profiles were employed and according to the results there were no significant differences in fatigue life for both kinds of bead profiles. The results of the models were compared with conventional weld calculations and validated with experimental tests. The theoretical fatigue life values were within the statistical confidence interval for p=95%.",
