The effect on effective diffusivity, water loss, sugar gain, color index (CIE-L*a*b*), water activity, sensory perception (color, texture and flavor), and consumption probability were measured. Effective diffusivity was influenced only by temperature of solution, presenting a maximum of 1.4E-4 cm2s-1. Water loss in OD registered a maximum of 40%. Color perception was affected by both variables. The consumption probability was influenced by the conditions evaluated with a maximum value of 80%. It was found the optimal conditions of OD in 65°Brix and 79 °C. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

This phenomenon, known as adsorption [18], can be estimated by analytical models and depends on several factors like the type of rock, degree of hydrolysis and polymer concentration, reservoir temperature, salinity of formation water, among other aspects. This paper shows the results of 144 statics tests where salinity (NaCl and CaCl2) and polymer concentration were taken as the parameters to be changed in order to determine which analytical model is the most accurate for the prediction of experimental results. The abnormal adsorption tendency with NaCl, indicates that the grater salinity value, the lesser adsorption value concentrations. This is mainly due to the response of the kaolinite substrate to flocculation. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

In addition, it is widely used as catalysts to produce hydrogen from natural gas. In this work, hydrotalcites based on nickel-aluminum and nickel-zinc-aluminum were synthesized, calcined at 500 °C and studied by different techniques. It was observed that nickel-aluminum hydrotalcites are thermally more stable, collapsing at higher temperatures than hydrotalcites containing zinc. During calcination, aluminum is incorporated into NiO lattice, leading to a decrease in crystallographic parameters. However, zinc decreases this effect, favoring the formation of NiO with lattice parameters close to pure nickel oxide. Zinc also contributes to the formation of smaller NiO particles, which is very useful for its use as a catalyst. In addition, aluminum led to a distortion in NiO lattice, an effect that is minimized by zinc, showing that it hinders the incorporation of Al3+ in the NiO lattice. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

The Inventory of Leadership Practices form was used (LPI) as well as a University Management (UG) scale, which consists of four dimensions: Research, Teaching, Extension and Support. These dimensions were applied to managers of 31 universities in Colombia. To identify the global relationship model between university management and the dimensions associated with transformational leadership a multiple regression model was developed. Furthermore, in order to eliminate subjectivities, we applied the transformation test of ordinal scales in a new Ridit-type scale until reaching the results. Among the main findings, there is a model of direct and positive relationship between Transformational Leadership and University Management. We also found that the Enabling to Act dimension in Transformational Leadership is the one having the greatest impact in university management.

Visual saliency perception is the process of locating and identifying regions with a high degree of saliency from a visual standpoint. Mesh saliency detection has been studied extensively in recent years, but few studies have focused on 3D point cloud saliency detection. The estimation of visual saliency is important for computer graphics tasks such as simplification, segmentation, shape matching and resizing. In this paper, we present a method for the direct detection of saliency on unorganized point clouds. First, our method computes a set of overlapping neighborhoods and estimates a descriptor vector for each point inside it. Then, the descriptor vectors are used as a natural dictionary in order to apply a sparse coding process. Finally, we estimate a saliency map of the point neighborhoods based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves similar results to those from the literature review and in some cases even improves on them. It captures the geometry of the point clouds without using any topological information and achieves an acceptable performance. The effectiveness and robustness of our approach are shown by comparing it to previous studies in the literature review. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

Compressive and flexure tensile strength tests were performed to mechanically characterize the mixtures produced, whereas porosity and constant head permeability tests were also carried out to assess the material hydraulic properties. Firstly, the experimental results were compared with the requirements established in international guidelines (ACI 522R-10, NBR 16416 (2015) and VTT-R-080225-13). The results complied with the guidelines indicating it is feasible to produce pervious concretes with the sustainable aggregates used in the study in low structural applications such as walkways.

Dependent variables were: moisture (Xw), pH, acidity, peroxide index (PI), viscosity (η), zeta potential (ζ) and color (CIE-L*a*b*). The best formulation was obtained by multiple optimization: DSG (20.9%), DSFA (28.9%) and lime color (0.029%), and its properties were: Xw (78.3%), pH (5.1), acidity (0.4%), PI (0.787 meq H2O2/kg), η (2952.2 cP), ζ (27.0 mV) and color (L*: 51.0, a*:-5.8, b*: 31.2). The AP is a raw material with industrial potential, which facilitates the production system of guacamole and its control. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

First, an analytical redundancy scheme for residual generation is applied using nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs for normal and faulty conditions. Simultaneous fault data is included in the training set in order to ensure multiple fault detection. Then, an adaptive filter considering statistic measures from input is used to increase sensibility and robustness. Filter coefficients are obtained off-line through genetic algorithm optimization. Finally, a neural network classifier is used for fault isolation. The proposed algorithm is tested on a rotary mechatronic test bench for backlash, bearing static friction and transmission faults to show the effectiveness of the proposed detection. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

The extraction parameters were temperature, extraction time and solid-solvent ratio. The optimal conditions for UAA-assisted extraction were: 48 ° C, extraction time of 28 min, and solid-solvent ratio of 0.0037 g / mL, with a predicted carotenoid content of 151.50 mg / 100 g of dry peel. To validate the optimized model, the experimental values were compared with the predicted values to verify the adequacy and fit of the model.

On average, 90% of drivers are aware of the risk of suffering from traffic accidents with deadly consequences when performing unsafe behaviors. The main reasons that drivers had to perform unsafe behaviors were lack of time and traveling without a bus attendant. The incentives that motivate a greater number of drivers to perform safe behaviours are rest time, receiving a bonus and recreation. The procedures of prevention that can produce a greater reduction of unsafe behaviors are: training plan, feedback, positive reinforcement and negative punishment. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

Changes in air density on cooling provide insufficient energy to account for the airflow. The finding is that the kinetic energy of the chilled air falls short by an order of magnitude, even to move a relatively small proportion of the 20 kg of air contained within the structure. Meanwhile the physics of condensation indicate a surplus of kinetic energy is made available from the air surrounding the locus of condensation. At low rates of condensation a considerable proportion of the available kinetic energy in the enclosed air is absorbed in friction and turbulence.

This study focuses on assessing the adhesion quality and rheological properties of both unmodified and nano-modified asphalt residues (AR) obtained from two sources of PHOC. The results suggest that the AR offer smaller stiffness and develop asphalt-aggregate interfaces with lower adhesion quality as compared to those generated by the control conventional asphalt. In general, the nano-modifier addition led to lower stiffness values for the AR, and although it improved the adhesion in dry condition, the susceptibility to moisture damage at the asphalt-aggregate interfaces was not reduced. Future research is suggested to validate these findings by assessing asphalt mixtures. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

For the proposed strategy, the sub-channel allocation is only considered for those new and handoff petitions that potentially can be allocated in one of the SCs. In addition, with the aim of contributing to the enhancement of the overall usage of radio resources, a traffic offloading process is considered at the departure of the sessions.

The maximum amounts of reducing sugars were 119.3, 114.6 and 104.8 g l-1 for PC → GE, GE→PC and the reference (without PC), respectively, while bioethanol concentration gradually increased to a maximum amount of 128.21, 106.74 and 85.91 g l-1 after 30 h for PC→GE, GE→PC and the reference (without PC), respectively. Although enzymatic activity (vmax) for each treatment was similar, in the reference (without PC pretreatment) it did not promote rapid substrate conversion into ethanol, despite showing the higher affinity enzyme-substrate (Km). Considering traditional potato starch hydrolysis, PC pretreatment shortened the reaction time of the biological reactions.

The objective is to maximize the profit generated for the completed services. Given the geographical dispersion of freight transportation demand services, it is common that some vehicles accumulate where they are not needed or they lack where they are indeed needed, thus it is important to balance the supply of vehicles and demand for services along the planning horizon. The size of practical problems encountered by logistic transportation companies are significantly large to solve in reasonable computational times, especially in road freight transportation. Consequently, heuristic methods are used to obtain feasible solutions, however, without a quality certificate of the solution. For this reason, this work applies two decomposition methods, which provides quality certificate of the solution, to obtain bounds in good computational times. The methods used are lagrangean relaxation with subgradient optimization and Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition with column generation.

Here we present a morphological and nanomechanical characterization of the parallel section of the axis of guadua Angustifolia kunth fibers (GAK) from Colombia, focusing on properties such as hardness (nanoindentation), roughness and topography. Our method was based on the application of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). AFM provided curves of force by displacement, as well as characteristics of dynamic nanoindentation systems and images. Their analysis revealed ridges and valleys on the surface of GAK fibers. The estimated surface roughness of 9.51 nm suggests an adequate value to provide superior adhesion between polymer and fiber. The same conclusion follows from our measurements of hardness, reduced modulus and nanoscale topography. Due to their excellent properties, we conclude that GAK fibers represent an ideal reinforcement material in polymer matrices. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

The marginal economic benefit caused by the integration of a new generation project is captured using the Differential Revenue Requirement method (DRR); whereas the operational benefits are observed by analyzing the performance of the new project through a preventive DC Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SCOPF) tool. The SCOPF also allows quantifying economic benefits due to replacement of expensive generation, transmission congestion, and N-1 security improvement. Additionally, another metric, called Net Benefit (NB) of a generation project, expressed as the difference between LACE and LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) is also employed in this work. It provides a realistic, easy-to-compute, and intuitive index that helps identifying the most promising generation projects during system expansion planning procedures. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied for computing LACE and NB of different generation projects in Colombia.

For this purpose, the ratios of starch:HBP employed to prepare the TPS were: 30:70 (TPS30), 40:60 (TPS40) and 50:50 (TPS50). Using infrared (IR) analysis, it was observed that the presence of HBP produced a displacement at the absorptions of the C-OH, C-O and C-O-C bonds of the TPS. The X-ray diffraction (DRX) analysis showed that the starch crystallinity is A and B type, which increased with the HBP amount. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the TPS, increased with the HBP content, but the thermal stability and viscosity (at an angular frequency of 1 Hz) presented an opposite behavior.

Subsequently the rheological analysis was done in order to determine yield stress and plastic viscosity, then the compressive strength was measured at 7 and 28 days of normal curing. Finally, the measurement of the self-compacting capacity by means of a V-funnel was performed. It was found that the FA influences positively because it reduces yield stress and self-compacting test times, but decreases the compressive strength in comparison to control sample. The addition of SF increases the yield stress and self-compacting times, but positively influences the compressive strength.

In this study, synergy was determined in the anaerobic codigestion of chicken manure with industrial wastes (sugarcane molasses, cheese whey, and crude glycerol). A simplex lattice mixture design was used to determine mixing ratios. Synergy was assessed in terms of substrate composition and ammonia inhibition. The greatest synergistic effects were achieved with ternary mixtures. Synergy was also noticed when total ammonia nitrogen concentrations decreased and the organic load increased.

While the Weibull data logarithm presents skewness, the lognormal data logarithm is symmetrical. This paper presents a method to discriminate between both distributions based on: 1) the coefficients of variation (CV), 2) the standard deviation of the data logarithms, 3) the percentile position of the mean of the data logarithm and 4) the cumulated logarithm dispersion before and after the mean. The efficiency of the proposed method is based on the fact that the ratio of the lognormal (b1ln) and Weibull (b1w) regression coefficients (slopes) b1ln/b1w efficiently represents the skew behavior.

This kind of map is proposed as a tool for selecting GMAW-S currents and voltages that enable welds with higher stability and quality. The map was constructed by analyzing current and voltage signals recorded during welding applications at 5000 samples/second. Adequate operation regions were defined over the map based on visual inspection results of bead-on-plate welds and the establishment of instability boundaries. Some examples were analyzed by locating two common parameters for industrial welding qualification (current and voltage) and drawing the limits established by AWS D1.1:2015 code for these essential variables (±7% PQR voltage and ±10% PQR amperage) on the frequency map. The results show that sometimes these limits may contain regions with poor stability related to electrode stubbing against the base metal and lack of arc re-ignition. © The author.

This paper presents the hysteresis characterization and modeling of the Tekscan A201-1 FSR employing the Preisach Operator (PO) function. In order to compensate for hysteresis during sensor operation, the inverse PO was numerically found on the basis of the Closest Match Algorithm (CMA). A test bench, capable of handling sixteen sensors simultaneously, was built, which allowed the characterization and later testing of the CMA. Grip force profiles were applied to the sensors during testing and the experimental results showed a considerable reduction in the force estimation error compared with the linear regression method proposed by the manufacturer. These results enable a wider use of FSRs in applications with tight accuracy requirements.

Waste represents a risk to public health and the environment, the dangerous type compounds that constitute them and the increase of their generation. In Colombia, there is a law of 1672 guidelines for the adoption of a policy that improves the management of WEEE. This Law proposes public management objectives, of which in this article three of them were evaluated (Reduction in generation, incentive to use, promote integrated participation). For this evaluation, a model was built using the Dynamics of Systems methodology, which allowed the establishment of the socio-environmental system structure for the generation and management of WEEE. Likewise, the evaluation scenarios were defined, the first is the initial or natural state that corresponds to the system without any strategy and the second is the system with the implementation of the strategies, which were divided into two groups. One is Economic Circular Strategies, Environmental Education and Job Promotion, and the other group contains the producer's extended liability strategies, citizenship incentives and the collection rate. Model simulations and scenario comparisons showed that the first group of strategies decreased in the generation rate of WEEE. Likewise, they allowed a second group of strategies on disposition rate.

This factor is highly dependent on the maximum lateral acceleration (ay) of a vehicle until it reaches the rollover threshold. This acceleration in turn is dependent on the vehicle speed and the radius of curvature.

This paper presents a multi-objective optimization focused on sustainable productions, for selecting optimal cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut) in multi-pass cylindrical turning operations. Both, the economic and environmental pillars of sustainability are considered as optimization targets. Technical requirements, such as cutting power, forces and surface roughness, are also taken into account as constraints. Optimization was carried out through a posteriori approach, where a set of non-dominated solutions, also known as Pareto front, were obtained and, then, the most suitable combination of targets is selected for the specific workshop conditions. Two gradient-free optimization techniques were used for carrying out the optimization: the non-sorting genetic algorithm II and the multi-objective particle swarm optimization. A study case was carried out not only for evaluating the fitness of the proposed approach but also for comparing the performance of the considered techniques. The outcomes showed a better performance by the genetic algorithms, in both the computational efficiency and the quality of the obtained Pareto front. The proposed approach demonstrated its convenience for sustainability optimization of machining processes, giving a simpler way for analyzing simultaneously the economic and environmental aspects of sustainability. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

The electron temperature, density, and electric potential were found to decrease as function of the distance from the spot region. However, the ion kinetic energy tends to increase due to the acceleration of the ions coming from the bulk region.

Besides, the increase of long-term rainfalls combined with poor runoff water collection systems in sanitary landfills causes greater production of leachate at the disposal sites. This paper examines the impact of solid wastes leachates on a tropical soil throughout the geotechnical characterization of two samples of residual soil, both sharing the same origin, one of them exposed to the effect of solid wastes leachates for over 15 years and the other one in natural soil conditions (uncontaminated). For this purpose, various laboratory tests were carried out to determinate the physical, chemical, structural, mechanical and mineralogical properties of soil samplings. The results suggest that the exposition of the contaminated sample to leachates modify significantly their physical, chemical, structural, hydro-mechanical and mineralogical properties, showing a degradation of the geotechnical behavior of soils exposed to contaminants.

The laminate was reinforced using two different types of reinforcement: lateral and perimetral. The plates were prepared using two different techniques. The first group of laminates was prepared by curing the reinforcement at 177 °C. The second group of laminates was prepared by secondary bonding of the reinforcement to the laminate at room temperature (22 °C). A numerical model was elaborated for comparison with the experimental results. Accuracy was observed when comparing experimental and numerical results, showing that the presence of residual thermal stress affects the value of the natural frequencies of free vibration and the characteristic modal form of reinforced plates.

A major challenge when working with CNTs is the difficulty to distribute them evenly throughout liquids. This research is a comparative analysis of the dispersion of multi wall CNTs (MWCNTs) in different liquid media (distilled water, ultrapure water of type I [Milli-Q], ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] and cell culture medium [RPMI-1640]) by using two different sonication techniques (probe-type sonication and ultrasonic bath sonication) as well as determining the effect of sterilization in the presence and absence of fluid before dispersion. The results indicate that the best method to achieve a CNTs dispersion is to use a probe-type sonicator as well as to sterilize the CNTs samples in the presence of fluid. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

Among those schemes are the Cross-layer protocols that constitute a good choice to achieve the aforementioned tradeoff by introducing novel protocol techniques which are away from the traditional communications model. In this work we assessed the performance of a WBAN cross-layer protocol stack by comparing it against the performance of the protocols of the IEEE802.15.4 standard, which is commonly used for WBAN deployment nowadays. We evaluated the performance of both, cross-layer and IEEE802.15.4 approaches, by means of a simulation, by using a popular network simulator and its frameworks for wireless networks. And then performed a statistical comparison and ascertained that the cross-layer protocol stack offers better performance regarding a tradeoff between efficient energy consumption and performance metrics in our particular test scenario. We observed that, in general, the cross-layer approach outperformed both modes of IEEE802.15.4 standard (slotted and unslotted) regarding energy consumption, end to end delay, packet loss rate and goodput. The results of our experiments reported that the cross-layer strategy saves up to 80% more energy than IEEE802.15.4 unslotted and it is only a 5% below the slotted mode. Regarding the quality of service metrics the performance was always better when using the cross-layer scheme. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

Seventeen compression tests without lubrication were carried out to cylindrical samples at room temperature. The Stress vs. Strain relationship was calculated using two friction corrections; the Rowe Correction and the Dieter Correction. It was concluded that the simulation made with the mortar contact method and the Dieter Correction is a good alternative to simulate the compression test, being the differences between the simulation and the experiments lower than 7.33%, the hypothesis of axial symmetric does not keep away the simulation of the reality and new numerical analysis will allow the development of better friction corrections. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

In real green selection contexts, sometimes a single static evaluation of suppliers is not enough for a conclusive decision and it is necessary to analyze suppliers’ evolution throughout different moments. Obviously, some parameters are not constant over time, rather they are dynamic and change from one period to another. Consequently, decisions about suppliers take place in a dynamic environment, where the final decision is made after an exploratory process. Besides, the available information is vague or imprecise that does not involve probabilistic uncertainty. In such situations, the use of 2-tuple linguistic model provides a convenient way to represent linguistic assessments through linguistic variables and to model uncertainty.

Multi-Focus Image Fusion (MFIF) aims to generate an image fe with extended depth-of-field from a set of images taken at different focal distances or focal planes, and it proposes a solution to the typical limited depth-of-field problem in an optical system configuration. A broad variety of works presented in the literature address this problem. The primary approaches found there are domain transformations and block-of-pixels analysis. In this work, we evaluate different systems of supervised machine learning applied to MFIF, including k-nearest neighbors, linear discriminant analysis, neural networks, and support vector machines. We started from two images at different focal distances and divided them into rectangular regions. The main objective of the machine-learning-based classification system is to choose the parts of both images that must be in the fused image in order to obtain a completely focused image. For focus quantification, we used the most popular metrics proposed in the literature, such as: Laplacian energy, sum-modified Laplacian, and gradient energy, among others. The evaluation of the proposed method considered classifier testing and fusion quality metrics commonly used in research, such as visual information fidelity and mutual information feature.

The study addresses a stiffness model of a micro-parallel kinematic machine (mPKM) by employing an approach involving kinematic and static equations. The objective of the model includes providing an understanding of the manner in which the stiffness of a mechanism changes as a function of both the position of an end-effector and the estimated cutting forces that are generated by micro-machining operations. An experimental prototype is considered for the preliminary validation. Three work planes and three cutting directions into the workspace are evaluated by iso-stiffness mapping. The results indicate that the mPKM operates with high stiffness performances in static operations. This is useful for suitable improvements in the prototype and developing analytical design criteria. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Task mapping in WNoC systems represents a challenging process, which often involves several optimization objectives, such as power, performance, throughput, resources usage, and network metrics. This paper describes a genetic algorithm based approach for finding optimal tasks-mapping solutions in design time, for embedded systems working over a WiNoC. The optimization objectives were: Speedup, Energy Consumption, and Bandwidth. The target network used for simulation may be viewed as a two-level hierarchical WiNoC. The first level corresponds to a set of subnets which are linked by wires and mesh-type. The second level corresponds to a star-topology of wireless links, which connect the first level subnets.

The adsorption kinetics follows, for small particles, a Langmuir isotherm pattern. The reaction exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics, giving respective apparent-Km and Vmax values of 30.2 g/l and 57.3 g/l.h. The better results in enzyme adsorption and pectin releasing were obtained with citrate and citrate-phosphate buffers. This report constitutes the first investigation in pectin solubilization involving a model for the substrate-binding mechanism within the pectinase-protopectinase system. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

It was observed that the greater interaction among carbonate ions and OH groups occurs at 250 °C, temperature at which the collapse of the HTLc structure occurs.

Therefore, multiple strategies have been developed to enhance magnesium properties. Coatings on magnesium alloys have been used to improve the cytocompatibility and corrosion resistance of magnesium. Particularly, titanium dioxide can be used as coating on magnesium to help regulating degradation rate and overcome some issues when magnesium is inserted into the human body.

Since the control area has an infinite set of points, the proposed model was formulated using semi-infinite programming (SIP). The problem was solved by using a version of Volkov–Zavriev’s (1997) stochastic outer approximations method, which consists of an active search for relevant constraints based in quasi-optimal functions. The concentration of the contaminant at each point in the region is obtained from a Gaussian model. Three cases were analyzed taking into account the Colombian standard for sulfur dioxide. The hypothesis that polluting sources should not be established within cities was supported. Lastly, results indicate that solutions that cost the least allow the harmful effects caused by sources in a control area to be estimated. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

To correctly understand the association that the environmental data (such as climate, vegetation cover, etc.) has with soil erosion susceptibility and land uses remains a challenge in land management. This paper evaluates land use interactions with macroscopic dynamics and microscopic soil properties in terms of soil’s susceptibility to erosion. We examine the reactivation of a stabilized gully in Nazareno (Brazil) by comparing field assessments with laboratory experiments, using two types of soil (well-developed soil and granite-gneiss saprolite). Both of these showed that the macroscopic behavior of soils is connected with microscopic characteristics. Well-developed soil is more erosion resistant than granite-gneiss saprolite, but the surrounding land uses do not respect these differences. These analyses enable us to explain why this and other gullies in the municipality are apparently stabilized, but soil loss continues to occur.

In saturated models, it was observed that when a wave advances, the maximum amplitude of the spectrum is shifted to lower frequencies, and that this maximum amplitude and its frequency are directly related. Besides this, the quality factor decreases with porosity and saturation. Hence, attenuation becomes higher when porosity, saturation, and frequency increase but tends asymptotically towards a constant value. Although phase analysis is generally discarded, it does provide interesting results. It was noted that the wave phase changes linearly with frequency at a rate of change that increases linearly with travel time. This rate increases with saturation but decreases slightly with porosity.

The chemical and mineralogical characterization made it possible to identify calcium and silicon as major elements associated with the concrete phases in the form of calcite, portlandite, hydrated calcium silicate, and hydrated calcium aluminosilicates. Calcium and silicon extraction was studied through a chemical and mineralogical analysis of CW (smaller than 4 mm), which was submerged in a citric acid solution for two days at 28°C and 110 rpm under controlled and uncontrolled pH conditions. Based on the concentration of calcium and silicon in solution, it was possible to conclude that after acidulation, this waste can be used as a source of nutrients for soils degraded by human use. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

The centrode contours may be controlled depending on the required maximum acceleration and smoothness of the centrodes. A comparison among elliptical, sinusoidal, and the new gears is provided. Results show that, for two-lobule gears, the maximum and minimum polar radii and gear ratios are the same for the new and sinusoidal profiles but differ for the elliptical ones. Conversely, there are significant differences in the maximum angular acceleration, tangential acceleration, and pressure angle. It is concluded that the novel gears provide not only small shaft accelerations, but also small tangential accelerations and pressure angles, and it is excepted that the elliptical gears may exhibit lower tangential accelerations and pressure angles for large values of the angular speed alternating component.

The effects correlated within the ionic conduction of the KNO3 compound were studied by impedance spectroscopy measurements in a frequency range from 0.1 to 10 MHz for a cooling cycle. The imaginary part of the impedance with a frequency between 200 and 100°C showed a displacement of the Debye-like peak in the lower frequency direction. This displacement indicates an increase in the relaxation times of ionic conductivity by jump. In the dielectric formalism module, the imaginary part showed an asymmetric peak as a correlation consequence in the cationic diffusion. Also the registers demonstrated that the process is thermally activated, with activation energy that is very close to the one obtained for dc conduction. From these results, it can be inferred that both, diffusion and conductivity mechanisms have the same origin.

In this sense, this paper presents a detailed analysis of a mixed wind park containing both doubly fed and squirrel cage induction generators. It considers different rates of capacity for each technology and implementing the gradual replacement of some fixed speed units by variable speed units. The study addresses aspects of voltage stability, fault analysis, wind speed variation and critical fault clearance time. The network used to perform simulations is a real system from Brazil.

In this paper, it is shown that the use of an Odd Harmonic High Order Repetitive Controller can be used to control the three-phase rectifier current loops with a performance that is considerably superior to traditional alternatives developed in this field. This compensator’s Odd Harmonic property keeps a computational complexity similar to that of the conventional repetitive controllers but it has the advantage of increasing the robustness when the signal frequency varies.

The study is carried out using the finite element method, considering two material models. Firstly, a numerical model is built assuming a bilinear behavior with strain hardening. Secondly, a model is elaborated considering the speed of deformation using the correlation of Cowper-Symonds. These models are compared and validated with experimental results taken from the literature. Subsequently, a parametric study is conducted, varying the dimensions and orientation of the mesh as well as the impact speed. The results show that the response of expanded metal tubes is sensitive to changes in the orientation of the geometrical axes of the mesh. Increasing the dimensions of the strands increase the material available for plastic deformation, this, in turn, produces an increase in the energy absorbed per mass unit. In addition, the loading speed causes a delay in the response of the specimens. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

Moreover, we performed DBS simulations for several geometrical models of the brain in order to determine whether geometry size, shape and ground location influence electric stimulation prediction by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Theoretical and experimental analysis show, firstly, that under the correct assumptions, the Laplace equation is a suitable alternative to describe the electric propagation, and secondly, that geometrical structure, size and grounding of the head volume affect the magnitude of the electric potential, particularly for monopolar stimulation.

It describes how humans contribute to accidents, and pays special attention to the assurance of process safety assurance, which is in part realized by timely reactions to system alarms. An experiment involving an operator’s reaction times to alarm signals was undertaken to investigate whether there are differential responses to visual as opposed to auditory alarms. The findings in the research show that visual alarm indicators are perceived faster than auditory signals. Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of errors and reaction time, indicating an individual difference in error-proneness when reacting to visual alarms in a supervisory task. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

Older workers are a valuable resource, but in order to ensure they stay in good health, prevention will be key. Wearable technologies are quickly becoming ubiquitous, individuals are turning to them to monitor health, activities and hundreds of other quantifiable occurences. Wearable technologies could provide a new means for employers to tackle the challenges associated with an aging workforce by creating a wide spectrum of opportunities to intervene in terms of aging employees and extend their working lives by keeping them safe and healthy through prevention. Employers are already making standing desks available, and encouraging lunch time exercise, is it feasible for Wearables to make the jump from a tool for individuals to a method for employers to ensure better health, well-being and safety for their employees? The aim of this work is to lay out the implications for such interventions with Wearable technologies (monitoring health and well-being, oversight and safety, and mentoring and training) and challenges (privacy, acceptability, and scalability). While an ageing population presents significant challenges, including an aging work force, this demographic change should be seen, instead, as an opportunity rethink and innovate workplace health and take advantage of the experience of older workers.

This system avoids detection of the parameters used as the cipher key by an attacker on implementing encryption by means of synchronized chaotic-phase masks of the Rössler oscillator, for encoding and establishing synchronization among transmitter-receiver devices. In addition, it employs two ciphering keys: the first, with a recommended length of 2,048 characters, and the second, which is used as an initial value. Both keys are employed for continual modification of one of the oscillator’s parameters. This strengthens the security system and avoiding an attacker from obtaining the oscillator’s parametric values by calculating the least average synchronization error. The use of the system developed provides a cipher, which is resistant to statistical attacks.

The original version included a linear evolution rule for the sake of simplicity, but did not include any empirical evidence for such law. This new version proposes an exponential law that provides a better fit to the experimental data. This law requires only two parameters with a clear physical interpretation.

The objective is to determine the impact on the detection velocity and false alarms of different degrees of autocorrelation and their interaction with process conditions—the aim being to effectively select parameters. The VP chart showed improvements in its performance when detecting large average runs as the autocorrelation coefficient increased in contrast with the traditional variable sample interval (VSI) and x quality systems.

In Brazil, there is a weakness in supervision at small construction projects. This is due to numerous factors, such as the low visibility of these types of works and short deadlines, as well as the lack of knowledge about Occupational Health and Safety. This study reinforces and illustrates the idea of the inherent dangers involved in the occupational health of workers in small construction projects. It also indicates that there is a need to put greater emphasis on compliance with Occupational Health and Safety principles, which are covered by the current Brazilian Legislation and Regulatory Standards.

The recorded data was used firstly to compare the different reactions of the subjects when using different design methods. A second analysis was carried out to determine whether the variations in the emotional parameters bore any direct relation to the creativity of the outcomes.

These materials were characterized by NH3-TPD and tested in tolune disproportionation reaction, under different conditions of pressure and temperature. As modification cycles were increased for each catalyst, there was a change in the acidity of the solids, mainly due to deposition of an inert layer of silica on the external surface. These results were confirmed with the improvement in para-selectivity and decreasing in conversion. Despite zeolite Beta is a large pore zeolite, an improvement of the para-selectivity was obtained, achieving almost stable values for the entire range of temperature and pressure conditions. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

The skarn-type mineralogy allows at least three paragenetic contexts to be distinguished, which are represented by the following neoformed minerals: (a) garnet, forsterite, diopside, titanite, wollastonite and calcite (early anhydrous metamorphic stage), (b) actinolite, tremolite, allanite and clinohumite (metasomatic or hydrated stage), and (c) chlorite, serpentine, sepiolite and quartz (late low temperature retrograde stage, probably due to infiltration of descending meteoric waters). The skarn-type mineralogy is observed as alteration halos developed around porphyritic granodiorites emplaced as sills between anisotropy planes related to metamorphic regional foliation of rock that are considered to be the causative bodies of the skarntype mineralogy. Zircon U-Pb ages obtained from granodioritic bodies yielded an age of 55.5±0.7 Ma (Ypresian, Early Eocene).

The identification and elemental and compositional quantification of minerals by these non-destructive techniques improve the quality of the results and allow a full analysis of the material. The data obtained by these techniques revealed the presence of garnet-type spessartine, in addition to trace elements and compounds that form the overall material. The structural refinement of spessartine was performed using the Rietveld method from data obtained by conventional diffraction and by using the MDI RIQAS analysis software. With the data acquired by μXRD using an area detector, a shorter exposure time (compared to that required by the 0L and 1D detectors) was achieved, and there was no need for particle size reduction of the mineral. It was also possible to identify the spessartine and other compounds in smaller concentrations (in situ measurements). By combining scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques, both worked from a characterization point of view. The examination by micro X-ray diffraction did not require physical separation of the sample.

Moreover, four simulation scenarios were performed in which the values of variables modified management strategies. The installed bioethanol production capacity was increased to observe the evolution of increased waste generation evaluated. The initial conditions for the simulation were modified to represent a production of about 2,500,000 liters / day. This leads to an increased generation of vinasse of over 400 million liters on average in a month and around more than 1 million tones of bagasse. The results are used to estimate the impact of management strategies on the amount of waste generated in the production of bioethanol. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

For all samples studied, IR spectroscopy showed the presence of the bands associated with water molecules present in the zinc oxide and carbon dioxide adsorbed on its surface. The formation of zinc oxide phase was confirmed by XRD, which showed that from 500 ºC it had this type of Wurtzite structure. However, samples calcinated at 600 ºC have higher crystallinity. Crystallite size was calculated using the Scherrer equation. The Rietveld method was used to obtain lattice parameters a and c for Wurtzite cell types as well as cell volume and the ratio c/a of each sample. These parameters do not show significant changes when they are compared with values obtained from samples with different calcination temperatures. Electron paramagnetic resonance showed the presence of defects in the zinc oxide. Three signals with g values of 1.96, 2.00 and 2.04 were associated with oxygen and zinc vacancies.

The FA100 system is based on fly ash (FA), which has an elevated content of unburned material (14.8%). The FA/OPC system is comprised of a mixture of fly ash and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) at a proportion of 80/20. The thermal performance was evaluated by several tests, such as exposure to high temperatures (up to1000°C) and direct flame resistance. In addition, the effect of cyclic exposure was studied at 700°C for 10 cycles. FA/OPC hybrid material retains 92% of its initial strength and FA100 retains 113.3% of its initial strength at 700°C. Both materials can withstand 10 exposure cycles with a strength loss of less than 45%. In direct flame exposure, a temperature gradient of about 500°C was observed. These results indicate that these types of materials could possibly be used as fire-resistant materials in civil structures. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

However, recent works indicate that the tensile strength values obtained through the Brazilian test must be increased by almost 26%. To understand this divergence, indirect tensile tests have been monitored. The aim is to know the material deformation and load increase by means of stepwise regression.

The study evaluates five computational intelligence algorithms, namely: the Firefly Algorithm, the Differential Evolutionary Algorithm, the Simulated Annealing Algorithm and two versions of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. Each algorithm is assessed based on the performance provided by two different network topologies under different data traffic loads and with a different number of wavelengths available in the network. The impact of implementing wavelength conversion processes is also taken into account in this study. Simulated results show that, in general, the evaluated algorithms appropriately solve the problem in small-sized networks in which a similar performance was found. However, key differences were found when the size of the network is significant. This means that more suitable algorithms optimize the search space and the fall into local minimums is avoided. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

However, before basing research on such archives, this information should be compared against in situ station measurements. Then, the present study assesses the validity of temperature and precipitation information furnished by University of Delaware’s database (UD-ATP) by means of a comparison with the open-access information available from Climate Explorer project (CLIMEXP).

We focused on two aspects of the cost calculation: the diseconomies of scale in software development and the impact of some project features that are used as cost drivers. We hypothesized that for these kinds of projects, diseconomies of scale are higher but the cost-increasing effect of the cost drivers is mitigated.

The crude was represented as a mixture of pseudo-components and for each one of them, the thermodynamic and critical properties were estimated. The results obtained in representing the oil with four, five and six pseudo-components show that all these representations produce similar results and therefore the use of four pseudo-components is sufficient and has a lower computational cost. Excellent results were obtained by comparing the experimental and calculated data. For this system, it is enough to have a complete characterization of the SARA analysis and to use four pseudo-components to adequately model the vapor-liquid equilibrium of CO2 -heavy oil. © The author."

Measures of friction coefficient and wear rate were obtained by ball on disc test. EEA analyses allowed to establish that the first 10 nm of the coatings are comprised probably of Bi4Ti3O12 and Ti2O3, AFM measurements indicate that the coatings have an average roughness of 22.28nm and grain size of 50nm. Finally, the tribological tests established that the coefficient of friction and wear rate of the coated steel has similar values to the bare steel. © The author."

This paper describes its manufacture in a succinct manner, and a thermal and energy comparison between the factory refrigerator and the refrigerator with the composite installed. Based on the experiments, it is concluded that when using the composite, the average internal temperature of the fridge is increased by 1°C, for practical and design purposes, the refrigerator still functions below 3°C. It was also found that at stable operating conditions the energy consumption using the composite saves approximately 1.5%. Despite these slight savings, the pyro-expanded perlite composite acts as a thermal isolating material.

This study was performed by injecting artificial partial discharge pulses in the stator winding of a 2.4 kV/210 kVA salient-pole synchronous machine. It was found that the propagation of the partial-discharge PD signals is presented in two modes: the slow mode, in which the coil acts as a transmission line; and the fast mode, in which the pulse propagates through the overhangs. The fast mode is due to capacitive and inductive couplings in the overhangs. In the slow mode, a PD signal manifests itself at the generator terminals after a transit time that depends on the distance traveled by the pulse. A strong positive linear correlation was observed between the arrival time in the slow mode and the length traveled by the pulse in this mode. The DC ohmic resistance between the injection point and the measurement point was used to represent the distance traveled by the pulse in the slow mode. The capacitive and inductive couplings also cause a crosstalk between the phases. As a consequence, a PD signal can be measured at different phases to the origin phase. In the slow mode, the signal will suffer attenuation in amplitude due to the dispersion and the absorption of energy while it propagates in the slow mode. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

Data from construction documents were collected to prepare a data base for probabilistic analysis. Data collected include scheduled construction time and cost, actual construction time and cost, and unexpected events which could have affected the construction process. Data were used in a probabilistic cost and schedule risk analysis to identify critical factors in construction time and cost overruns in the region. It was found that the activities that most affect the time and cost overruns are the construction of the granular base and the asphalt layer.

Demand curve parameters and round size were varied to evaluate their impact over auction outputs. Results show that the demand curve has a quite small impact over bidders’ decisions and round size management is useful to avoid non-competitive bidders’ behavior.

A comparison between particle swarm optimization (PSO) and BA was made in the 33-node and 69-node test feeders, using as scenarios the change in active and reactive power, and the number of generators. PSO and BA found good results for small number and capacities of generators, but BA obtained better results for difficult problems and converged faster for all scenarios.

As a result, researchers in the field of geotechnical engineering, specifically in the context of ""biotechnology"" or ""bioengineering"", have been investigating the use of microorganisms to improve the geotechnical properties and stability of soils. Using this approach, this work was developed to analyze the effects of the implementation of a calcium carbonate precipitating nutrient in native microbiota on the mitigation of erosion processes in a tropical soil profile. The methodology used in this research consisted of collecting undisturbed samples in a soil profile located in an area affected by erosion processes. In such samples, the native bacteria were identified, and it was determined that the nutrient B4 induced the precipitation of calcium carbonate. Subsequently, soil samples were characterized physically, chemically, mineralogically and mechanically in their natural state and after the addition of the nutrient. The tests were performed at least fifteen days after treatment with the nutrient. It was concluded that the use of the nutrient B4 enabled the native bacteria present in the soil to precipitate calcium carbonate, resulting in improvements in the physical, chemical, mineralogical and mechanical properties of the soil, which allowed for the mitigation of erosion processes that characterize the soil profile studied. The conclusions derived from the study apply not only to other tropical soil profiles subjected to erosion but also to improvements of the geotechnical behavior of soils in general. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

[1] analyzed the influence of the attributes’ dependence when ranking a set of alternatives in a multicriteria decision making problem with TOPSIS. They also proposed the use of the Mahalanobis distance to incorporate the correlations among the attributes in TOPSIS. Even in those situations for which dependence among attributes is very slight, the results obtained for the Mahalanobis distance are significantly different from those obtained with the Euclidean distance, traditionally used in TOPSIS, and also from results obtained using any other distance of the Minkowsky family. This raises serious doubts regarding the selection of the distance that should be employed in each case. To deal with the problem of the attributes’ dependence and the question of the selection of the most appropriate distance measure, this paper proposes to use a new method for synthesizing the distances to the ideal and the anti-ideal in TOPSIS. The new procedure is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process and is able to capture the relative importance of both distances in the context given by the measure that is considered; it also provides rankings, which are closer to the distances employed in TOPSIS, regardless of the dependence among the attributes. The new technique has been applied to the illustrative example employed in Vega et al. [1]. © The author."

The mathematical model is presented as a Mixed Integer Non Linear Problem (MINLP). Several works on the state of art of the problem have revealed that the computational effort of this problem grows exponentially with the number of time periods and number of thermoelectric units. Therefore, we present two alternatives to solve a STGP based on Benders’ partitioning algorithm and Lagrangian relaxation in order to reduce the computational effort. The proposal is to apply primal and dual decomposition techniques, which exploit the structure of the problem to reduce solution time by decomposing the STGP into a master problem and a subproblem. For Benders’ algorithm, the master problem is a Mixed Integer Problem (MIP) and for the subproblem, it is a Non Linear Problem (NLP). For Lagrangian relaxation, the master problem and the subproblem are MINLP. The computational experiments show the performance of both decomposition techniques applied to the STGP. These techniques allow us to save computation time when compared to some high performance commercial solvers. © The author."

Therefore, a clear definition of the concept of comfort and clear knowledge of its contributing factors are important when designing comfortable prostheses. However, there are currently no standardized methods to adequately measure prosthesis-related comfort. The aim of this study is to identify the factors that underlie the concept of comfort with prosthesis use in transfemoral amputees. Forty-one transfemoral amputees completed a questionnaire to evaluate the perception of comfort and to analyze the influence of six factors. It found a significant model that correctly classifies 84.9% of the cases. It can predict whether the patient feels comfort while using the prosthesis.

The stresses on the whole trailer were found by using a finite element model, where the joint with the maximum stresses was identified. This joint was constructed with a tubular structural element using Friction Stir Welding and was evaluated by bending tests.

Different preserving agents (sodium chloride, nitrite, nitrate, among others) are added in this process. Nowadays, more attention is paid to the amount of salts added and the salting time employed. For this reason, it is important to know the factors governing salt penetration and the most convenient process conditions. The transfer mechanism of the salts through the structure is an interesting aspect in meat and fish processing technology. Mathematical models are the best way to discover the factors, which govern this process, which may represent and explain the observed data and predict the behaviour under different conditions. The objective of this review is to describe the use of the mathematical models to simulate meat and fish salting and the benefits derived from their use. Most of the models used to describe the salting process are diffusional, based on Fick’s second law, although empirical ones are also used. For modelling purposes a good description of the experimental results should be guaranteed. The complexity of the model will depend on the objective to be reached and will be analysed in each case. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

First, the optimum solution is determined for a problem of maximization of entries, based on historical records from the traffic and information center of Valparaiso Port. Second, this solution is used to establish a strategy for making “the best possible decisions.” The combination of the optimization and the fuzzy results (which consider the type of cargo, prices, and capacity) is performed at two levels. First, the optimization results are used as feed for the fuzzy system to determinate a ratio of future acceptances. Second, the optimization results are compared to the fuzzy system results in order to estimate a parameter to establish the minimal percentage value for accepting a request.

Essentially, these strategies allow the allocation of most iterations to the most promissory regions in an organized manner using only subsets with similar or the same characteristics as those of the optimal solutions at each level of the tree, thus assuring a broad search within the feasible region and, simultaneously, a good exploitation by the selective use of the subsets by level.

Four different structures were used. The first three molecules have a continental structure, with condensed aromatic cores, while the forth has an archipelago structure, with small groups of aromatic rings connected with saturated chains. The molecules were constructed in an atomistic framework, in which atoms are described individually. Interaction forces were calculated at 300 K and 200 atm; Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were evaluated separately. For all four molecules the solubility parameter was calculated. It was found that Van der Waals interactions due to the presence of aromatic rings and electrostatic forces caused by the presence of heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, are equally relevant in the aggregation of asphaltene molecules. For all molecules it was found asphaltene systems are more stable in aggregation state than in monomeric state. For continental structures, the presence of long ramifications obstructs the formation of asphaltene aggregates. For archipelago structures, the flexibility of the molecules enables the aggregation with other structures. The presence of heteroatoms creates a repulsive force that hinders the aggregation process. The molecular volume and the cohesive energy are also sensitive to the geometric configuration and the composition of the species, which affects the solubility parameter. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

The tests showed that the material supports direct fire without producing any flame, it has an ultimate strength of 80-120 kPa when tested at temperatures ranging between 150-200 C. The thermal conductivity was found close to 0.09 W/m.K. At outdoor conditions (Dry bulb temperature: 30°C ± 5°C, Relative humidity: 80% ± 15%) the material was not attacked by natural fungus.

Cohesion study was carried out by molecular simulation techniques (Monte Carlo) using a primitive model in a canonical ensemble (NVT). The proposed model takes into account the influence of ionic size of each particle and the addition of polyelectrolytes with different charge number and separation. The results obtained show that electrostatic interactions are responsible for the cohesion of the hardened cement. It was found that in absence of cationic polyelectrolytes, cohesion is lost when the C-S-H lamellae are at separations larger than 1 nm. Adding cationic polyelectrolytes generates a distribution of hydroxide ions around the polyelectrolyte charges, facilitates the distribution of calcium and sodium ions in the entire space between C-S-H surfaces; this allows the cohesive forces exist at greater distances of separation between the surfaces. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

Recently, Compressed Sensing (CS) technique has been used satisfactorily in Raman Spectroscopy Imaging, reducing the acquisition time by simultaneously sensing and compressing the underlying Raman spectral signals. The Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imager (CASSI) is an optical architecture that applied effectively the CS technique in Raman Spectroscopy Imaging. The main optical element of CASSI system is a coded aperture, which can transmit or block the information from the underlying scene. The principal design variable in the coded apertures is the percentage of transmissive elements or transmittance. This paper describes the technique of CS in Raman Spectroscopy imaging by using the CASSI system and realizes the selection of the optimal transmittance values of the coded apertures to ensure an efficient recovery of Raman Images. Diverse simulations are performed to determine the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the reconstructed Raman data cubes as a function of the transmittance of the coded apertures, the size of the underlying Raman data cubes and the number of projections expressed in terms of the compression ratio. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

An analysis of the state of the art of this technology shows the selection of the working fluid as an open research line, since until now there is no fluid that can meet all environmental and technical aspects to be considered in these cycles. Hence, we have developed a series of simulations that allow us to study the behavior of the Rankine cycle with different configurations and fluids (wet, dry and isentropic) which has led us to observe the influence on the overall cycle efficiency when we change the type of fluids used (refrigerants, hydrocarbons and water) as well as the conditions of temperature, pressure, flow, etc. With the work realized, the viability of this type of processes is demonstrated for the recovery of heat in industry and/or the use of renewable sources of low and medium temperature for the production of electricity. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

These policies have been formulated as a “second best” option to congestion charging as the latter policy has been deemed politically unfeasible so far. The idea underlying license plate restrictions is very simple: by not allowing a proportion of the total number of vehicles to circulate on a given day, congestion levels and other externalities are expected to decrease, improving the quality of life for people.Based on a simple microeconomic analysis, supported by a review of the literature and by evidence collected in several cities where these restrictions have been implemented, it is concluded that the policy is apparently effective only in the very short-term, but ultimately it fails to achieve its objectives and usually leads to a worse outcome. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

First, the mineralogical and chemical composition of the wastes and clayey soil were determined. Next, bricks were fabricated with different quantities of waste (5%, 10% and 20%). The effect of adding these wastes on the technological behavior of the brick was assessed by compressive strength, flexural strength and durability tests. Based on the results obtained, the optimum amounts of agroindustrial waste to obtain bricks were mixing 10% of cocoa shell and 90% of clayey soil.

The alkaline pH increases the rate of dissolution by several orders of magnitude. The electrolytic medium (Cl- or SO42-) does not seem to significantly influence the dissolution of aluminum, but increase the charge density, which helps in the electrochemical process. The results are related to the nature of aluminum hydroxide species formed during anodic dissolution. In acidic and neutral conditions, OH-ions from the cathode do not fully participate in the formation of neutral species of aluminum hydroxide and excess OH-ions increases the pH of the medium. In contrast, the pH decreases in highly alkaline conditions attributed to the consumption of large amounts of OH-ions to form an anionic species such as Al(OH)4-and Al(OH)52-, and other polymeric species of aluminun. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

A public bicycle system consists of a set of points where you can pick up and deliver bicycles; a headquarters where a group of vehicles taking leftover bikes and transported to the points where a deficit (the demand exceeds supply) exists. One of the major problems that arise in systems of public bike is balanced, which involves sending bikes from the point where an offer (bicycles left over) to the point where there is a demand (bikes missing) occurs. The way to model this problem is with an adaptation of the vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery (VRPPD), allowing each route make partial deliveries to customers and limiting the number of customers to visit by each route. In this paper an integer linear programming model is introduced and a metaheuristic based on granular tabu search to find a local optimum. Instances from 15 to 500 customers adapted from the literature are used.

This process has two disadvantages: production of liquid waste and it is in batches. Extrusion has resolved the problem of liquid waste, however, extrusion as of yet, has not been able to replace the traditional process of nixtamalization. This is because corn dough is a pseudoplastic fluid, which changes its viscosity in the presence of high shear velocities that occur inside the extruder. With this in mind, the following investigation proposes the mechanical design and construction of a low shear laminar transport system (LSLTS) for the production of corn dough for tortillas. This system consists of two thermally isolated stages: transport and cooking stages. The results showed that the prototype obtained meets the characteristics of homogenous cooking, low shear, absence of liquid waste and the product meets the specifications for nixtamal dough. © The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

However, wishing to apply it to real cases with varied geometry the results were not satisfactory due to several reasons which will be examined in this article. This limiting situation for the equation is inconvenient for two reasons: First, whatsoever it is a very used equation due to its simplicity and to the fact that involve geomorphologic parameters, without requiring tracers. Secondly but not the less important, because it is based on fundamental mechanisms that are widely accepted, and then they should not lead to results in conflict with experiments.

The relative intensity ratio of Raman D and G bands increased as the substrate temperature increased from 20 to 100°C.

Experiments included artificial damage introduced in the middle of the cable by cutting and gradually increasing the cut depth from 1mm to 9mm. The attained results suggest a change of guided modes excitation and reception from F(1,1) to L(0,1) due to reduced friction contact among individual wires.

The procedure for analyzing the behavior of the proposed cycle consisted of modifying the input pressure, temperature and/or discharge pressure of the turbine with working fluid at conditions of both saturation and overheating. Results show that the efficiency of the cycle for this fluid is a weak function of temperature, i.e., overheating the inlet fluid to the turbine does not cause a significant change in the efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio in the turbine increases, it is much more efficient, and also, as the input temperature to the turbine rises, the efficiency increases more sharply. Furthermore, the effect of adding an internal heat exchanger to the cycle was analyzed, giving as a result a maximum efficiency of 11% and 14% for the basic cycle and with an internal heat exchanger, respectively. © The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

Samples of TBC deposited onto Inconel 625 substrate were fabricated and heat treated at two different conditions: exposition to 1100°C up to 1000 hours and exposition to temperatures between 700°C and 1100°C during 50 hours. According to Rietveld refinement measurements, the content of the cubic phase in the top coat increases with time and temperature; it starts at 7.3 wt.% and reaches 15.7 wt.% after 1000 hours at 1100°C. The presence of a cubic phase in high amounts is undesirable due its lower mechanical properties compared with the tetragonal phase. After 800 hours of exposure to high temperature, the amount of Y2O3 in the tetragonal phase reduces to 6.6 wt.% and a fraction of this phase transforms to a monoclinic structure during cooling. The monoclinic phase reached 18.0 wt.% after 1000 hours. This phase is also undesirable, not only due to its higher thermal conductivity, but also because the tetragonal-to-monoclinic transformation implies a volume change of circa 5%, which favors crack formation and propagation and compromises the coating integrity. © The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

This term describes the drainage generated by natural oxidation of sulfide minerals when they are exposed to the combined action of water and atmospheric oxygen. AMD is characterized by acidic effluents with a high content of sulfate and heavy metal ions in solution, which can contaminate both groundwater and surface water. Minerals responsible for AMD generation are iron sulfides (pyrite, FeS2, and to a lesser extent pyrrhotite, Fe1-XS), which are stable and insoluble while not in contact with water and atmospheric oxygen. However, as a result of mining activities, both sulfides are exposed to oxidizing ambient conditions. In order to prevent AMD formation, a great number of extensive research studies have been devoted to the mechanisms of oxidation and its prevention.

In this kind of crops is very important the use of advanced techniques and new technologies to improve the crop efficiency. This work presents an advanced system to monitor the variables applied on greenhouse crops. The monitoring system uses a wireless sensor network (WSN) that works with 6LoWPAN and RPL as the routing protocol. It measures humidity, temperature, light, and volumetric water content in the soil. The WSN sends the recollected data to an embedded device which stores the information on a data base, so it is possible to visualize in real time the values obtained of crops as a graphic. The developed system allows installation flexibility and adaptation to any greenhouse. Because it is based on: Wireless technology, nodes can establish links automatically, and have implemented a function for saving energy which can extend the life of the batteries enough for a crop year without maintenance. © The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

The new Christian church from Rome expands and includes kings and emperors. The Christian pope seeks to compel all believers to subscribe the closed religious perspective of that time. However it is religious people who recognize the necessity to observe nature and the world in a different way. The discovery, translation and diffusion of the classic Greek philosophers' texts allow the initiation of independent thinking, which in turn, spurs the Renaissance and Illustration ages. The inductive thinking method begins with the purpose of finding other ways to interpret nature and advance the thought process. Therefore during the XVI century alchemy is questioned and the first treatises on empirical metallurgy appear, considered to be the foundations of modern science. During the XVII century some individuals begin experimenting with residual alchemical concepts. The first hypotheses on key chemical concepts and phenomena appear which frame the logic and rational thought process during the XVIII century. The concept of affinity emerges as a way to describe the relations among substances, observed during the formation of compounds, and as an analogy to human relations. Published works regarding the components of the thinking process consolidate the basic concepts of chemical bonding and related themes. © The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

More of research efforts are devoted to solve these issues. However, other models emerged from statistics would be more appropriated than neural networks for forecasting, in the sense that the process of model specification is based entirely on statistical criteria. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is a statistical model commonly used for solving nonlinear regression problems, and it is possible to use it for forecasting time series. Nonetheless, there is a lack of studies comparing the results obtained using MARS and neural network models, with the aim of determinate which model is better. In this paper, we forecast four nonlinear time series using MARS and we compare the obtained results against the reported results in the technical literature when artificial neural networks and the ARIMA approach are used.

With N1 data it was obtained a kind of viscosity known as dilatant viscosity which was found only for those suspensions with a volumetric concentration higher than 0.13. This dilatant viscosity depends on the shear rate and the CV, and it was modeled with the power law structure having good coefficients of determination. Finally it was found that the dilatant viscosity with a CV= 0.2 is almost five times the value of the shear viscosity, thus demonstrating that for a better understanding of the deformation stage must be taken into account the normal stresses in shear flow happening in the kaolin concentrated suspension. © The authors; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia."

The key advantage of this image processing pipeline is the simultaneous use of features computed from the intensity properties of the image in a cascading pattern which makes the computation self-contained.

In this work, the densifcation data required to construct the master sintering curve of a 3-mol% yttria stabilised zirconia powder have been obtained. Bulk samples prepared by cold pressing, as well as thick flms made of the same powder applied to a rigid substrate, were sintered. The free and constrained sintering experiments have been performed applying three different heating rates, with and without isothermal step at a maximum temperature of about 1450 °C. The shrinkage of the samples was measured in situ during densifcation using a push rod dilatometer. Also, a conventional box furnace was used, applying the same heating schedule, to compare the results. Microstructural analysis has been achieved by using scanning electron microscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy, and optical microscopy. An acceptable agreement was obtained between similar samples sintered in the dilatometer and the box furnace, indicating that the dilatometer data could be used for both environments. The bulk samples reached lower densities than the flms, probably due to their lower initial densities. For the samples free of constraint, a master sintering curve was achieved with an activation energy of 550 kJ mol-1. For the constrained case, problems associated with the substrate and the uncertainties in the measurements hindered the characterisation of the flm, i.e., a single master sintering curve could not be produced."

A zero-flux initial-boundary value problem (IBVP) posed for this PDE describes the settling of a suspension in a column. The parameters for a given material are estimated by the repeated numerical solutions of the IBVP (direct problem) under systematic variation of the model parameters, with the aim of successively minimizing a cost functional that measures the distance between a space-dependent observation and the corresponding numerical solution. Two important features of this paper are the following. In the first place, the method proposed for the efficient and accurate numerical solution of the direct problem. We implement a well-known explicit, monotone three-point finite difference scheme enhanced by discrete mollification. The mollified scheme occupies a larger stencil but converges under a less restrictive CFL condition, which allows the use of a larger time step. The second feature is the thorough sensitivity and stability analysis of the parametric model functions that play the roles of initial guess and observation data, respectively."

The presence of moisture causes a reduction in aggregate-binder adhesion in the mix as well as in the internal cohesion of the bitumen. This leads to problems such as pot holes, aggregate peeling, stripping, etc., which eventually lead to the structural failure of the pavement. Currently, there are numerous laboratory tests that analyze the susceptibility of bituminous mixes to moisture, providing a qualitative or quantitative evaluation. This study analyzes the performance of bituminous mixes in different experimental conditions. For this purpose, a comparative study of two laboratory tests was carried out. The tests differed in mix compaction method, the conditioning of the test specimens, and the type of load applied. The results obtained showed that in these tests the conditioning temperature had a greater impact on mix performance than the temporal duration of the conditioning process. Furthermore, the application of tensile stress was found to be more suitable for studying moisture susceptibility since mixes were found to be more sensitive to this type of load."

The results showed that the lower the thickness, the faster the drying, the lower the values of aw and the higher the ΔE. The samples reached 0.0652, 0.1132 and 0.2624 g water/ g dry solid in 60 min for 2, 3 and 4 mm slices, respectively.

Such a procedure generates a significant reduction in the computational burden required in comparison with classical approaches. The experiments presented in this paper confirm the advantages of the model: Low computational burden, high accuracy reproducing the experimental data, and its usefulness to perform energetic evaluations for viability analysis."

The preliminary results show that real and apparent non-uniform heating is effectively compensated with this method, resulting in better images of possible internal defects than other classic methods like Differential Absolute Contrast (DAC), and therefore increasing the probability of more efficient detection and characterization procedures; specifically, the non-uniformity effect on the original sequence could be reduced by about 74%, according to a non-uniformity parameter defined in this work, as well."

In this research, the behavior of a composite utilizing SCSP (replacing 33% of the sand, by volume) combined with four types of inorganic matrices was evaluated, one of them based on ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and three alternative matrices containing pozzolans by OPC replacement, such as ground fly ashes (GFA) and spent fluid catalytic catalyst for petrol (FCC) (A:100%OPC; B:50%OPC+50%GFA); C:50%OPC+40%GFA+10%FCC and D:50%OPC+30%GFA+20%FCC). Composite performance was evaluated daily by non-destructive ultrasonic test (NDT) and, after 28 days, by flexure and compression tests. Results showed the influence of the composite age on ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), finding a stabilization on UPV values at 28 days; and also the great influence of the matrix type on composite mechanical performance. Flexural and compressive strengths of composites with matrix A showed superiority when compared to the alternative matrices. Among them, matrix D showed superiority. In a general way, 33% (by volume) sand replacement by SCSP sharply decreased the composités mechanical performance: bending strength (a reduction of 9% to 24%) and compressive strength (a reduction of 38% to 53%).

Mechanical properties of the beads were evaluated through tensile tests and microhardness measurements. Defects generated in the joints were analyzed using optical and scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that mechanical properties were strongly affected by the welding parameters, whereas the kind of machine influenced the presence of defects in the joints.

SIM is useful and effective in obtaining highly accurate thermodynamic data for sorption of gases by microporous and nanoporous materials at low temperatures and pressures.At high temperatures and pressures desorption is not negligible, therefore SIM can not be applied. The errors in the calculation of the isosteric heat using SIM can be reduced using traditional experimental procedures such as adsorption isobars and isotherms to generate isosteres at high temperatures and pressures. Alternatively, corrections by pressure and temperature or an experiment that, after each temperature increase, allows gas dosage to compensate for the amount of mass desorbed would guarantee a constant adsorbed amount and, therefore, isosteric behavior by direct measurements."

Results of exact sciences work are shown, in order to give an idea of what alchemy was at its beginnings. Over the time, alchemy was polluted with religious thoughts, transforming its language to a dark one. Its main goals were to take advantage of spirits (vapors) contained in substances forming the elixirs to reach the metallic transmutation, and to find the Philosopher's Stone (The Elixir), which would serve for the transmutation of base metals into gold and to get an eternal and healthy life. The work of the early alchemists, their equipment, and the elixirs and alloys they used, are described. The possible chemical reactions -representing breaking and formation of bonds due to chemical affinity- that could explain the changes observed by them, are presented.

Experimentation, the act of responding to situations and needs as they were presented, and practice, ran alongside each other since the Bronze Age, but were independent of the development of Greek thought.

But procedures involving these tools might be expensive or time consuming. This study uses image analysis of laser diffraction patterns, obtained from intact bacterial colonies in order to asses its suitability to differentiate bacterial colonies. We also tested the effect of the colony incubation period on these patterns, and the role of the volume of culture media on the laser light diffraction patterns. Laser diffraction patterns were obtained from the five bacterial isolates B1, B2, B3, B2Ca y B2Cb. Bacterial colony differentiation by its diffraction patterns was assessed using isolates B2, B3, B2Ca. The role of colony incubation period on obtained diffraction patterns was tested by using isolates B1 and B2Cb, whereas agar plates without colonies were used to assess the role of different volumes of culture media on its laser diffraction patterns. It was found that the volume of culture media may reduce the quality of the laser diffraction patterns. A multivariate dimensional analysis on laser diffraction patterns also indicated that these can be used to differentiate the bacterial colonies included in the test. Finally, the length of the incubation period on the differences among diffraction patterns of the same isolate appears to be negligible. It is concluded that this simple technique could be used to support the design of sensible equipments based mainly on cheap, locally available supplies, which in turn might support industry and research needs requiring fast and accurate bacterial colony detection."

The aim is definitely to take some measures to cut not only general costs in the usual outsourcing field, but also operation and core processes costs, following mostly the modern BPO. Moreover, a new economic activity is generated around BPO, which can be interesting for the Spanish strategic consultancy firms. Some aspects like economies of scale and the consequent obtaining of minor costs or the know-how of the companies which provide this kind of services that could even produce an increase in the chapter of incomes based on economies of scope make that BPO clients think at least of the possibility of including them in some of their processes and sub-processes.

The present work is focused on the production of furfural from D-xylose using aluminum and hafnium pillared clays as catalysts. After 4 h of reaction at temperatures ranging between 140 and 170°C, conversion rates of 50-80% were observed, and selectivity levels of 40-65% were reached. Finally, the stability of the catalyst was further investigated by applying a thermal treatment prior to reuse. A significant decrease in the selectivity was not observed in four consecutive reactions. Consequently the pillared clays appear to be active, selective and stable catalyst for pentose dehydration."

The lack of ventilation control in these facilities, along with wind direction and velocity effects on ventilation uniformity, complicates calculation of the quantity of gases (ammonia and others) generated by the litter at a given moment. This fact constitutes a pitfall when evaluating the polluting potential of open environments, and when comparisons with data encountered in closed environment facilities used in temperate climates need to be done. All developed countries of Europe and North America already possess methodologies to determine gas emissions in closed installations commonly found in these regions. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate some specific methodologies used for determining ammonia emissions from broiler houses located in countries of Europe and the United States, and verify the possibility for application of these methodologies to open structures commonly found in Brazil and other countries of South America. A quantitative evaluation showed that the methods with best characteristics for adaptability to the operational conditions and the different types of conditioned environments of buildings with positive pressure or natural ventilation systems were the internal tracer gas, the portable monitoring unit (PMU) and the mobile air emissions monitoring unit (MAEMU). According to the results, model-based approaches that use mass balance and passive diffusion samplers such as the ""Ferm Tube"" and the Saraz Method for Determination of Ammonia Emissions (SMDAE) proposed by Osorio (2010), can also be adapted to different operational conditions for open buildings."

The new method is a generalization of the General Geometry Ewald-like Method (GGEM); it combines continuum and statistical mechanics through a Green's function formalism for the long-range interactions. In this way, the separation of time and length scales, commonly encountered in soft matter fluids, is avoided. The fundamental equations behind electrokinetic problems are exposed and the paper finishes with a description of the novel Nernst-Planck-GGEM approach."

Equilibrium sorption of asphaltenes in rock powders, within a range of concentrations from 250 to 1500 ppm, was determined using a static method. Sorption curves show Type I behavior, according to IUPAC. The Langmuir model was used for computing the monolayer asphaltene content values for the sorption at different temperatures, showing a good fit with respect to the experimental data. Sorption kinetics of asphaltenes in rock samples is a function of the concentration and for concentrations of 1500 ppm equilibrium is reached at about 90 min. Pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to the experimental data for the different concentrations for the two rock samples, with a better result for the pseudo-first order kinetic model.

Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) was also tested for comparative purposes and was exposed to identical experimental conditions. The monitoring of open-circuit potential, the linear polarization resistance technique, and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were used to evaluate the corrosion behavior of the steel bar. Corrosion resistance of carbonated AAS and OPC concretes was tested at different times. We carried out an exposure test of a solution containing Cl ions with all series for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Electrochemical measurements show that AAS concrete presents depassivation of the steel embedded in concrete where it is exposed to accelerated carbonation; after this period of time, corrosion resistance decreased due to the presence of chlorides at the steel/AAS interface."

We obtain a matching of 99% between structural properties predicted by the density functional theory and structural ordering, found from the Rietveld refinement method. From field cooling measurements of susceptibility as a function of temperature, we determine the occurrence of a magnetic ordering for a critical temperature of 44.8 K. From a fitting with the molecular field theory of ferrimagnetism, we establish that the ordering corresponds to a paramagnetic-ferrimagnetic transition, which is corroborated by the behavior of the inverse of susceptibility as a function of temperature. The Curie constant allowed for us to obtain an effective magnetic moment of 3.5 μ B.

The dc-conductivity of the films increases by increasing both the glycerol content and temperature. A power-law dispersive behavior of the frequency-dependent conductivity at high frequencies has been observed in all G/S films in the blend compositions prepared, similar to that observed in other solid ionic conductors and known as a ""universal dynamic response."" The electrical conductivity enhancement is consistent with the subtle changes in the -OH glycerol groups coordination with the starch chains introduced by increasing the glycerol content and temperature. A stable single phase is revealed under the electrical measurement conditions up to approximately 100 °C for all concentrations, but the stability can be maintained up to higher temperatures (~150 °C) at glycerol concentrations below G/S = 0.4."

The developed converter is based on traditional interleaved boost converters interacting with voltage multiplier cells where the circuit symmetry has been broken, obtaining an inherent discontinuous conduction-operating mode that provides a high voltage conversion ratio in comparison to traditional solutions. Such low-ripple and high boosting conditions make this converter an ideal candidate for photovoltaic systems design, in particular for grid-connected applications. The converter circuitry is analyzed, and a design procedure is proposed in terms of typical photovoltaic systems requirements, providing simple but useful equations. Finally, the converter design is illustrated by means of a realistic design example and validated by using an experimental prototype."

Therefore, three input variables were used: temperature-humidity index (THI), noise level (dB) and ammonia concentration (ppm), and the output variable was the work environment classification (WEC).

In this work a second stage is proposed to reduce localisation error without severely increasing the computational load. This stage consists of iteratively updating the set of possible regions based on previous reconstructions, in order to focus on those brain regions with a higher probability of being active.

Corresponding results suggested that the failure criterion selection can lead to significant differences in the laboratory fatigue life prediction (i.e., fatigue curves). However, for the dense-graded md10 mixtures, the fatigue curve was similar in disregarding the failure criteria applied. On the contrary, for the dense-graded md20 mixtures, application of the three failure criteria led to significant differences in fatigue life prediction; the smallest load cycles to failure (most critical) was determined based on the classic criterion.

To this end, a speech synthesizer is implemented on a personal computer connected to a cell phone, which allows one to establish a mobile call without using the human voice. The speech synthesizer uses the diphone concatenation technique and is developed specifically for the Spanish from Colombia. A mathematical description of the synthesizer shows the decomposition of the synthesizer into various mutually independent processes. Several user-acceptance and quality tests of the obtained signal were performed to evaluate the performance of the tool. The results show a high signal to noise ratio of generated signals and a high intelligibility of the tool."

An NFR does not determine the function of the system itself, but the quality characteristics of an IS; for example, error handling, auditing, and access control. Non-functional requirements are often included in the coding phase of the IS, and these generally are present in various parts of the source code (i.e., they are scattered and tangled), which implies a difficult concept and even more difficult maintenance. In addition, we know that maintenance works are becoming more frequent due to both the technological and the functional changes of the IS. In this paper we present a proposal to define and include the NFR in the early stages of the analysis and the design of IS development. On the one hand, we use the aspect-oriented software development approach (AOSD) to model and maintain the NFRs as aspects. On the other hand, we use the model-driven engineering approach (MDE) to formalize this approach. For this, we create a unified modeling language (UML) profile. Then, we make use of MDE transformation mechanisms to obtain the complete model (with functional and non-functional aspects), and finally, a source code is generated; but this step is beyond the scope of this paper."

Therefore, compared to HMA, WMA offer several engineering, economical, and environmental advantages. However, research is still required to identify the response, properties, and performance of WMA, since it is still a relatively new technology. This paper focuses on the analysis of the internal structure of WMA specimens compacted using both the Superpave Gyratory Compactor (SGC) and the Texas Gyratory Compactor (TxGC). This analysis was conducted in terms of the air voids (AV) characteristics assessed by applying X-ray computed tomography and image analysis techniques. The results obtained suggest that the addition of WMA additives and corresponding reduction of the compaction temperature for SGC specimens did not lead to significant changes in the vertical distribution of total AV content, as compared to that of the control-HMA. However, some differences were reported in terms of the AV size, which suggests the existence of discrepancies in the aggregate packing condition. Therefore, additional research is suggested to fully validate the equivalence of the internal structure of both WMA and HMA."

Consequently, this paper focuses on the assessment of the internal structure of WMA (computed in terms of the connected air voids (CAV) characteristics), fabricated using three WMA additives: Asphamin®, Sasobit®, and Evotherm®. The CAV content corresponds to the fraction of air voids (AV) forming connected paths in a compacted specimen and is better related to the asphalt mixture response (e.g., permeability) than the total AV content. The CAV analysis was based on X-ray computed tomography scanning and subsequent image analysis. Corresponding results suggest the need for additional research to further characterize field compacted mixtures, produced at densification levels comparable to those achieved in the laboratory. In addition, the inclusion of WMA additives and corresponding temperature reductions did not substantially affect the internal structure of gyratory-compacted specimens (115 mm in height) produced for laboratory mixture evaluation."

It was also observed that physical chemical water properties might have an important effect on paint efficiency, particularly the presence of particulate matter in the water or important variations of water oxygen content."

This lack of detailed models of the pretreatment stages prompted the current study that describes a model which includes the variables listed above and provides an important tool for predicting the degree of lignin removal in lignocellulosic materials such as sugarcane bagasse (Saccharum officinarum L). The model considers kinetic expressions available in the literature. The kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the model to experimental data obtained for that purpose in our lab. The experimental matrix considered eighteen, 24-h isothermal experiments in which bulk and residual delignification stages were observed to occur in a parallel manner. Carbohydrate removal and hydroxide consumption were related to lignin removal by effective stoichiometric coefficients that were calculated by fitting the experimental data. A mixing compartment network model that represented mixing inside the reactor was included into a temporal superstructure based on the similarity between plug flow reactors and ideal batch reactors to model a non-ideally mixed batch reactor. The kinetic model was validated with data obtained in this study."

Experimental values were adjusted by using the GAB, BET, Henderson, Smith, Caurie, and Peleg models. The isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) was determined using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The results showed that yellow pitahaya fruits exhibit type III adsorption isotherms and that the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) is temperature-dependent. For the same water activity value, the EMC decreased when temperature increased. The GAB model presented the best fitto the experimental values. The Qst dropped from 57.154 to 45.79 kJ/mol when the EMC increased from 0.05 to 0.40 g water/g dry matter, respectively. These results are important for establishing the best storage conditions for dehydrated pitahaya fruits as well as for shelf-life prediction and the design of packaging materials."

As a result of the application of this strategy, a well-suited tool is obtained to relate a set of inputs to a single output in a classical regression task, which is next used to determine the fault distance in power distribution systems, using single end measurements of voltage and current. The proposed approach is initially tested in a simplified regression task using two functions in Â1 and Â2, where the results obtained are highly satisfactory. Next, the selection of the adequate calibration parameters is performed in order to adjust the SVM using a cross validation strategy, where an average error of 5.75 % is obtained.

The effects of brush parameters on brush dynamics are identified. Notably, for the VAP function, a condition similar to resonance tends to occur in the stronger plane for bending deflections, when the frequency of the brush is an odd fraction of a natural frequency of the bristle for that plane. The model can also be applied to study the dynamics of a small-deflection cantilever beam, when the transverse external force is a squared, sinusoidal, triangle, or VAP wave."

The present study looks at the use of an integrated remediation system using zeolites for the treatment of wastewater and sediments. Zeolites have been widely studied in the past 10 years due to their attractive properties such as molecular-sieving, high cation exchange capacities, and their affinity for heavy metals. Coal industry by-products-based zeolites (faujasite type) have been tested as an effective and low-cost novel alternative for wastewater treatment, particularly their removing of heavy metals. On the other hand, a preliminary laboratory-scale experiment was conducted on the use of natural zeolites (clinoptilolite type) for the retention of heavy metals from canal sediments. Experimental work revealed promising results, which could be replicated on a bigger scale. Although this has been developed for canal sediments, the remediation strategy can be adapted to different waterways such as rivers. The development of the proposed remediation system in a specific experimental site as the major part of an innovation park can provide great benefits to a population living near contaminated effluents. It provides not only opportunities for the mitigation of environmental impact, improving water quality and landscape amenity, but also allows for several recreational opportunities."

By means of the measured response, it was verified that loading history of the QSC testing ignores the foremost dynamic effects observed in structures subjected to earthquake loads. When dynamic and QSC responses were compared, it was apparent that stiffness and strength degradation properties depend on the loading rate, the strength mechanisms associated to the failure modes, number of cycles, and cumulative parameters such as ductility demand and energy dissipated.

The instability line defines the onset of static liquefaction for loose sandy materials in the p-q space of effective stresses under undrained loading conditions. The onset of static liquefaction is predicted by means of a recently developed criterion and specialized to an elastoplastic constitutive model. The performance of this criterion is compared with laboratory tests showing satisfactory results. For a given void ratio and different mean pressures, it is found that the mobilized friction angle at the onset of static liquefaction is not constant. Therefore, the instability line is not an intrinsic property of the sand, but depends on the current state of the material. This work re-interprets the hypothesis given by VaidandChern, which has been amply used to analyze liquefaction phenomena."

The second, is inherent to a physical reality, considering that the road network, regardless of their design and/or establishment support a maximum traffic flow and a maximum density defined by their size, number of lanes and traffic conditions. All demonstrate, that more sophisticated than the system is, it is not possible to improve the performance of traffic flow per unit of time, beyond the physical limitations imposed by the road design and traffic regulations. On the other hand, initial investment costs plus operating costs and external costs related to the efficient flow of traffic are a third factor to consider as a result of the previous two.

Additionally, the deterministic analysis of the state variables is performed by means of a Compensation-Based Radial Load Flow (CBRLF). Such load flow efficiently exploits the topological characteristics of the network. To deal with distributed generation, a strategy to incorporate a simplified model of a generator in the CBRLF is proposed. Thus, depending on the type of control and generator operation conditions, the node with distributed generation can be modeled either as a PV or PQ node. To validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the IEEE 37 bus test system is used.

In order to understand these changes, spatial and temporal historic fluctuations in regional rainfall patterns must be analyzed. In this context, precipitation trends were analyzed using a non-parametric statistic Mann-Kendall test for annual, seasonal and monthly rainfall between 1975 and 2006 for 108 precipitation ground stations located in the upper and middle Cauca river basin. The results demonstrate that the significant trend of annual rainfall variation was between -9.3% (-147,3mm) and +6.5% (+128mm) per decade and the average change was -0.7% per decade for 24 stations.In the seasonal intra-annual analysis of June-July-August, a period of lower intra-annual rainfall, we found the largest statistically significant decrease in seasonal rainfall, with an average of -15% per decade, in 19% (21) of the total stations. The conclusions are that the pattern of seasonal precipitation changed between 1975 and 2006 and before to compare the annual rainfall trends with geographic variables (latitude, longitude and altitude), we found that rainfall had decreased in all cases above 1500 m in altitude and in latitudes lower than 3o52'N within the Andean Mountains. These changes in precipitation will decrease the volume and availability of runoff, which will alter the water availability in the river basin.

This represents a decrease in the time required for sintering and lower energy consumption. These two facts are due to the reactive species generated in the plasma and because the heating is done directly by the bombardment of ions and neutral atoms on the surface of the sample, which is usually placed on the cathode discharge. In this paper we use the abnormal glow discharge of low pressure as an alternative method for the sintering step of the ceramic YBa2Cu3O7-d. The physical properties of samples sintered in glow discharge were compared with the properties of samples sintered in resistive furnace, which is commonly used for production of such materials. Then, a structural analysis is carried out by XRD and microstructural analysis by SEM of YBa2Cu3O7-d samples, which were sintered by the two methods. The experimental results allowed to establish a similar structure for both cases and a lower surface porosity in the samples sintered by plasma. In addition, in the plasma sintering process, the samples show a slight contamination of the surface. The contamination is produced due to sputtering of cathode material of the discharge and can be easily removed by mechanical methods (sanding). © 2012 2006, Revista DYNA."

Our analysis shows that the most used techniques are the ARIMA model and artificial neural networks. However, it appears unclear evidence on which model is most appropriate and in what cases, in addition, the studies do not present a specific recommendation to develop models for forecasting demand, specifically in the Colombian case.

Equations that evaluate the required minimum stiffness of the lateral and torsional bracings and the corresponding ""braced"" critical buckling load for each column of the story level are derived using the modified stability functions. The following effects are included: 1) the types of end connections (rigid, semirigid, and simple); 2) the blueprint layout of the columns (i.e., the cross section orientation and location of the centroid of each column); 3) shear deformations along each column using the modified method initially proposed by Haringx in 1948; and 4) axial load distribution among the columns (i.e., load pattern). The effects of axial deformations and warping torsion are not included. The proposed method is applicable to 2D and 3D framed structures with rigid, semi-rigid, and simple connections. The formulation presented in this paper is based on a previous work presented by Aristizabal-Ochoa in 2007. It is shown that the minimum stiffness of lateral and torsional bracings required by a multi-column system depend on: 1) the blueprint layout of the columns; 2) the variation in heights and cross sectional properties among the columns; 3) the flexural and shear stiffness of each column; 4) the load pattern on the multi-column system; 5) the lack of symmetry (in the loading pattern, column layout, column sizes, and heights) that cause the combined torsion-sway buckling all of which reduce the buckling capacity of the frame as a whole; and 6) the support conditions and restraints at the top end of the columns. The proposed method is limited to multi-column systems with elastic and orthotropic columns with doubly symmetrical cross sections (i.e., with a shear center coinciding with the centroid) oriented in any direction with respect to the global axes. Four comprehensive examples are presented in detail in a companion paper that shows the effectiveness and simplicity of the proposed method."

Also, as expected, SEM micrographs show that the plasticization process destroyed the starch granular structure almost completely and an amorphous mass was obtained. The TGA results indicated that the activation energy, Ea, was also reduced by the plasticization process.

This paper presents a new method for fitting a NURBS surface over an unorganized and scattered cloud of points, preserving its sharp features. In contrast with other methods, ours does not need either to construct a network of NURBS patches or polygon meshes. By reducing the dimensionality of the point cloud using ISOMAP algorithms, our method detects both regions with lacking points, and regions where the cloud is too dense. Then, the cloud is regularized by inserting and removing points, and it is approximated by a NURBS surface. An evolutionary strategy obtains the weights of the NURBS surface in order to improve the representation of sharp features."

Typical formulations of these models were calibrated using the cross-sectional data corresponding to each year. Then, to identify time-dependent effects, the resulting parameters were regressed as a function of a time index. The results indicate the presence of statistically significant time-dependent effects on all freight generation models (production and attraction), as well as on the freight distribution model estimated with loaded vehicle trips. In contrast, the parameters of the freight distribution models based on commodity flows were found to be stable overtime."

The ""modified"" stability approach based on Haringx's model described by Timoshenko and Gere (1961) is utilized in all matrices. The proposed stiffness matrices can also be used in the inelastic analysis of frames whose members suffer from flexural degradation or, on the contrary, stiffening at their end connections. The closedform secondorder stiffness matrix and load vector derived and presented in this paper find great applications in the stability and secondorder analyses of framed structures made of beamcolumns with relatively low shear stiffness such as orthotropic composite polymers (FRP or composites) and multilayer elastomeric bearings commonly used in seismic isolation of buildings. The effects of torsional warping along the members are not included. Analytical studies indicate that the buckling load and the stiffness of framed structures are reduced by the shear deformations along the members. In addition, the phenomenon of buckling under axial tension forces in members with relatively low shear stiffness is captured by the proposed equations. Tension buckling must not be ignored in the stability analysis of beamcolumns with shear stiffness GAs of the same order of magnitude as EI/h2.

Although this phenomenon it is well known for more than one century, its cientific basis are not known yet and there is not available a mathematical model which explains its behavior when it is subject to changing experimental conditions such voltage, geometry, weight, relative humidity and temperature of its environment. Besides the replication of this exceptional phenomenum, several straightforward experiments were carried out to show some of its outstanding characterístics. Because it needs a high voltage difference between its electrodes, it was proved that it works as a conventional electrostatic separator because it eliminated solid particles from a gas sample confinated in a container or flowing, with the advantage of low energy requirements. In the same way, at the operational conditions, it produces ozone in a controlled way. It seems due to the strong air ionization as observed in the well known corona effect."

The results found that, even though the numerical value for the mass transfer coefficient is a small number (about of 10 -7 m/sec), moisture content predictions were sensitive to this value. The predicted drying curve compared favorably with published results."

Over the past few years, due to an increasing awareness of environmental issues, different approaches to solve the GEP problem have included some sort of environmental policy, typically based on emission constraints. This paper presents a linear model in a dynamic version to solve the GEP problem. The main difference between the proposed model and most of the works presented in the specialized literature is the way the environmental policy is envisaged. Such policy includes: i) the taxation of CO2 emissions, ii) an annual Emissions Reduction Rate (ERR) in the overall system, and iii) the gradual retirement of old inefficient generation plants.

However, some authors have called the attention on the importance of taking the higher modes into account, due to their influence in the distribution and demand of both, moments and shears along the vertical elements, with significant effects. In this work, the method presented allows to consider, in a practical way, the effect of the higher modes on the seismic response of a structure. The proposal to achieve it, is a simplified model of Three Degree of Fredom developed from a mass concentration of four points equally distant along the building height. This method corresponds to an iterative process, in which the analysis and design procedures are carried out simultaneously, thus, avoiding considerations or suppositions on resistance and ductility values. This method has been applied to the structural walls of a 15storey building. The results obtained show the efficiency of the method in terms of the proposed objectives achievement and the fast converging of the iterative process involved.

For kinetic purposes in this kind of reaction, the radiation distribution has to be well known, since the reaction rate is strongly dependent on the photon absorption rate. The present work develops a mathematical model which allows simulating the reflection of direct solar radiation on a CPC. Using analytical geometry and vector calculation, equations were evaluated, first for calculating the Cartesian coordinates of the reflecting surface. Later these points are used to calculate incident and reflected rays layouts on the collector. Visual Basic (Excel environment) program was developed for data generation and plotting the reflected rays at any instant. The incident radiation on the receptor was plotted separately displaying the daily direct energy distribution in the absorber. Also the involute length (collector) was calculated with these data, which can be very useful information for collector construction. Results obtained after simulations show that the distribution of incident energy on the absorber surface depends on the surface reflectivity. The incident energy is larger at the top of the absorber than the bottom zone and it is more convenient higher surface reflectivities for more uniform energy distributions. This mathematical model can be a first approach for absorption models which include direct solar radiation in photochemical or photothermal applications."

The validity of the method was tested in a crossvalidation process. The results compared favourably with those obtained using ordinary cokriging and fuzzy kriging."

As an example it is presented a simulation study called ""Robustness of a three-state Markov model under different distributional specifications of the transition times"" that was completed under the approach of the experimental design and using the analysis of variance and multiple regression model in order to prove the effect of the sample size, maximum number of visits and the type of distribution of the transition times on the estimation of the parameters in a three-state Markov model."

The objective of the present work is to show the results of the comparative study of costs between two articulated buses that operate with different fuels: compressed natural gas (CNG) and diesel. The results will be used to establish the economic viability of fleet implementation in the massive transport systems of the biggest Colombian cities. The projection was made following the operation and maintenance recommendations given by the buses manufacturers, a life expectancy of 10 years, a total of 6250 km of road trip by month and two different scenarios for fuel price evolution. Three important costs were considered: engine and indispensable, fuel and preventive maintenance. The capital costs and fixed costs (like employee salaries, parking, taxes, and insurances) were assumed to be equal for the two types of buses. The results shows that the operation and maintenance costs have a similar behavior between both technologies, although preventive maintenance costs are smaller for the bus fueled with natural gas, situation that changes when the engine and indispensable costs are reviewed. Nevertheless it is important to write down that the greater influence on the operation and maintenance costs falls into the time behavior of the fuel price."

This article presents a review of the state of the art at the time of its publication. It is hoped that this work will motivate research on the subject of Model Updating in places different from those where developments in this area have concentrated, and that it will provide sufficient information for Latin-American industries to include this technology in their practice."

The proposed methodology consists in utilizing a vulnerability index correlating it to a damage index in function of a given seismic event. The vulnerability index model corresponds to the model reported formerly by Maldonado et al., 2007. The damage index was determined by a demand/capacity ratio, evaluating the stress using the Abrams' Model. The function design process required the utilization of a wide sample of buildings. Simulation techniques allowed the running of simulation in 6000 hypothetical buildings. For each hypothetical building its vulnerability index and its damage index was calculated for different maximum acceleration values, ranging from 0,05 g to 0,25 g. Probability of seismic damage vulnerability and matrix functions were constructed with these data for each of these acceleration values. Thus, the functions and matrixes of damage probability contributed to understand the damage that masonry buildings might endure in a given value of maximum acceleration in function of its vulnerability estimate. The functions defined in this study were utilized in the assessment of damages produced by a seism of a given level in buildings located at a sector of the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga at the Municipality of Floridablanca."

In this work it is presented an overview of the five more important experimental strategies in the search to improve the CO tolerance: reduce the on set potential for the CO oxidation reaction, reduce the amount of adsorbed CO, introduce small quantities of oxidant bleeding into the anode feed, increase the operation temperature and cleaning the CO in the fuel feed. Even though quite promissory catalysts have been developed (PtMo and PdAu mixtures), still the PtRu systems are regarded as the most efficient anode catalysts for fuels containing over 10 ppm of CO. The strategy of inject oxygen to the anode appears promissory, but it requires the development of new more efficient membranes and the implementation of more safe operation conditions of the fuel cell. The structural design of special anodes containing multiple layers with specific catalysts for each type of fuel can become a very attractive strategy."

The experiments were done to 35°C, using different proportions of pulp. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showing grain morphologies that make evident different mechanisms of oxidation for both sulfides. After oxidation, the sphalerite looks an elemental sulphur layer, with core residues displaying embayment corrosion, indicating an active oxidizer environment. The sulphur layers showing concentrically banding, indicating several pulses of deposition. On the other hand, pyrite crystals displayed embayments and pits of corrosion, without sulphur layers. The principal products of the oxidations of both sulfides were, besides elemental sulphur, jarosite and another iron sulphate. The sequential formation of this mineral phases and the preferential oxidation of sphalerite more than pyrite was made evident."

Using measures of zeta potential and flotation in tube Hallimond, confirmed that the flotation of the kaolinite is dependent of the pH and of the concentration of the collector. The conditions of better flotability are presented to pH=4.1 and 3.75*10-4 M of CTAB. The interaction mineral/collector happens by means of a mechanism adsorption/precipitation. The infrared spectroscopy for transformed of Fourier (FTIR) it allowed to determine that the cations of the amine forms strong bonding, type bridges of hydrogen, with the groups present silanol in the mineral surface. The evolution of characteristic bands of species adsorbed corresponding to the vibrations N-H is observed, OR-H, If-OH and Si(Al)-O. The attraction of CTAB on the kaolinite surface causes a reduction in the intensities of the bands corresponding to the vibrations OH and new bands appear in the region understood between 3500 and 3700 cm-1. When working with concentrations of the collector of 4.76*10-4M the formation of micelar structures strong it is appreciated on the surface of the kaolinite and a decrease is observed in the flotation answer."

The different selected gestures are recorded in video sequences, which are processed and classified in real time. Several image processing techniques are applied in each frame, in order to achieve an appropriate feature extraction and classification of gestures. After that, the output of the classifier is used as the input of a state machine which stabilizes the command selection and sends the selected operation to the robot's command interface. The method shows to be very effective for real time applications, giving both enough speed and good gesture detection."
