"Towards high-capacity fibre-optic communications at the speed of light in vacuum","10.1038/nphoton.2013.45","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875809097&doi=10.1038%2fnphoton.2013.45&partnerID=40&md5=8edf29f636269e8e3da96fc4f6d080f3","Wide-bandwidth signal transmission with low latency is emerging as a key requirement in a number of applications, including the development of future exaflop-scale supercomputers, financial algorithmic trading and cloud computing. Optical fibres provide unsurpassed transmission bandwidth, but light propagates 31% slower in a silica glass fibre than in vacuum, thus compromising latency. Air guidance in hollow-core fibres can reduce fibre latency very significantly. However, state-of-the-art technology cannot achieve the combined values of loss, bandwidth and mode-coupling characteristics required for high-capacity data transmission. Here, we report a fundamentally improved hollow-core photonic-bandgap fibre that provides a record combination of low loss (3.5 dB km -1) and wide bandwidth (160 nm), and use it to transmit 37 × 40 Gbit s -1 channels at a 1.54 μs km -1 faster speed than in a conventional fibre. This represents the first experimental demonstration of fibre-based wavelength division multiplexed data transmission at close to (99.7%) the speed of light in vacuum. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We propose a new measure of low-latency activity to investigate the impact of high-frequency trading on the market environment. Our measure is highly correlated with NASDAQ-constructed estimates of high-frequency trading, but it can be computed from widely-available message data. We use this measure to study how low-latency activity affects market quality both during normal market conditions and during a period of declining prices and heightened economic uncertainty. Our analysis suggests that increased low-latency activity improves traditional market quality measures-decreasing spreads, increasing displayed depth in the limit order book, and lowering short-term volatility. Our findings suggest that given the current market structure for U.S. equities, increased low-latency activity need not work to the detriment of long-term investors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","High-frequency trading; Limit order markets; Liquidity; Market quality; NASDAQ; Order placement strategies"

We find that AT causes an improvement in two measures of price efficiency: the frequency of triangular arbitrage opportunities and the autocorrelation of high-frequency returns. We show that the reduction in arbitrage opportunities is associated primarily with computers taking liquidity. This result is consistent with the view that AT improves informational efficiency by speeding up price discovery, but that it may also impose higher adverse selection costs on slower traders. In contrast, the reduction in the autocorrelation of returns owes more to the algorithmic provision of liquidity. We also find evidence consistent with the strategies of algorithmic traders being highly correlated. This correlation, however, does not appear to cause a degradation in market quality, at least not on average. © 2014 the American Finance Association.",
"The high-frequency trading arms race: Frequent batch auctions as a market design response","10.1093/qje/qjv027","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84947758001&doi=10.1093%2fqje%2fqjv027&partnerID=40&md5=e5e912332d73ad5186989413e4be854b","The high-frequency trading arms race is a symptom of flawed market design. Instead of the continuous limit order book market design that is currently predominant, we argue that financial exchanges should use frequent batch auctions: uniform price double auctions conducted, for example, every tenth of a second. That is, time should be treated as discrete instead of continuous, and orders should be processed in a batch auction instead of serially. Our argument has three parts. First, we use millisecond-level direct-feed data from exchanges to document a series of stylized facts about how the continuous market works at high-frequency time horizons: (i) correlations completely break down; which (ii) leads to obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities; and (iii) competition has not affected the size or frequency of the arbitrage opportunities, it has only raised the bar for how fast one has to be to capture them. Second, we introduce a simple theory model which is motivated by and helps explain the empirical facts. The key insight is that obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities, like those observed in the data, are built into the market design-continuous-time serial-processing implies that even symmetrically observed public information creates arbitrage rents. These rents harm liquidity provision and induce a never-ending socially wasteful arms race for speed. Last, we show that frequent batch auctions directly address the flaws of the continuous limit order book. Discrete time reduces the value of tiny speed advantages, and the auction transforms competition on speed into competition on price. Consequently, frequent batch auctions eliminate the mechanical arbitrage rents, enhance liquidity for investors, and stop the high-frequency trading arms race. © The Author(s) 2015.

Over the last fifteen years, the use of statistical and econometric methods for analyzing high-frequency financial data has grown exponentially. This growth has been driven by the increasing availability of such data, the technological advancements that make high-frequency trading strategies possible, and the need of practitioners to analyze these data. This comprehensive book introduces readers to these emerging methods and tools of analysis. Yacine Aït-Sahalia and Jean Jacod cover the mathematical foundations of stochastic processes, describe the primary characteristics of high-frequency financial data, and present the asymptotic concepts that their analysis relies on. Aït-Sahalia and Jacod also deal with estimation of the volatility portion of the model, including methods that are robust to market microstructure noise, and address estimation and testing questions involving the jump part of the model. As they demonstrate, the practical importance and relevance of jumps in financial data are universally recognized, but only recently have econometric methods become available to rigorously analyze jump processes. Aït-Sahalia and Jacod approach high-frequency econometrics with a distinct focus on the financial side of matters while maintaining technical rigor, which makes this book invaluable to researchers and practitioners alike. © 2014 by Princeton University Press.

Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, OSNs can be used to harvest private user data, distribute malware, control botnets, perform surveillance, spread misinformation, and even influence algorithmic trading. Usually, an adversary starts off by running an infiltration campaign using hijacked or adversary-owned OSN accounts, with an objective to connect with a large number of users in the targeted OSN. In this article, we evaluate how vulnerable OSNs are to a large-scale infiltration campaign run by socialbots: bots that control OSN accounts and mimic the actions of real users. We adopted the design of a traditional web-based botnet and built a prototype of a Socialbot Network (SbN): a group of coordinated programmable socialbots. We operated our prototype on Facebook for 8 weeks, and collected data about user behavior in response to a large-scale infiltration campaign. Our results show that (1) by exploiting known social behaviors of users, OSNs such as Facebook can be infiltrated with a success rate of up to 80%, (2) subject to user profile privacy settings, a successful infiltration can result in privacy breaches where even more private user data are exposed, (3) given the economics of today's underground markets, running a large-scale infiltration campaign might be profitable but is still not particularly attractive as a sustainable and independent business, (4) the security of socially-aware systems that use or integrate OSN platforms can be at risk, given the infiltration capability of an adversary in OSNs, and (5) defending against malicious socialbots raises a set of challenges that relate to web automation, online-offline identity binding, and usable security. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Elasticity allows applications to rapidly change their configuration on-the-fly (e.g., the amount of used resources) in response to dynamic workload fluctuations. In this work we face this problem by adopting the Model Predictive Control technique, a control-theoretic method aimed at finding the optimal application configuration along a limited prediction hori-zon in the future by solving an online optimization problem. Our control strategies are designed to address latency constraints, using Queueing Theory models, and energy consumption by changing the number of used cores and the CPU frequency through the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) support available in the modern multicore CPUs. The proactive capabilities, in addition to the latency-and energy-awareness, represent the novel features of our approach. To validate our methodology, we develop a thorough set of experiments on a high-frequency trading application.

Therefore, this paper aims to provide the first systematic literature review on the state-of-the-art application of EC techniques for rule discovery in stock AT. Out of 650 articles published before 2013 (inclusive), 51 relevant articles from 24 journals were confirmed. These papers were reviewed and grouped into three analytical method categories (fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and blending analysis) and three EC technique categories (evolutionary algorithm, swarm intelligence, and hybrid EC techniques). A significant bias toward the applications of genetic algorithm-based (GA) and genetic programming-based (GP) techniques in technical trading rule discovery is observed. Other EC techniques and fundamental analysis lack sufficient study. Furthermore, we summarize the information on the evaluation scheme of selected papers and particularly analyze the researches which compare their models with buy and hold strategy (B&H). We observe an interesting phenomenon where most of the existing techniques perform effectively in the downtrend and poorly in the uptrend, and considering the distribution of research in the classification framework, we suggest that this phenomenon can be attributed to the inclination of factor selections and problem in transaction cost selections. We also observe the significant influence of the transaction cost change on the margins of excess return. Other influenced factors are also presented in detail. The absence of ways for market trend prediction and the selection of transaction cost are two major limitations of the studies reviewed. In addition, the combination of trading rule discovery techniques and portfolio selection is a major research gap.

The bid-ask spread of the LOB is modeled by a tick-valued continuous-time Markov chain. We consider a small agent who continuously submits limit buy/sell orders at best bid/ask quotes, and may also set limit orders at best bid (resp. ask) plus (resp. minus) a tick for obtaining execution order priority, which is a crucial issue in high-frequency trading. The agent faces an execution risk since her limit orders are executed only when they meet counterpart market orders. She is also subject to inventory risk due to price volatility when holding the risky asset. The agent can then also choose to trade with market orders, and therefore obtain immediate execution, but at a less favorable price. The objective of the market maker is to maximize her expected utility from revenue over a short-term horizon by a trade-off between limit and market orders, while controlling her inventory position. This is formulated as a mixed regime switching regular/impulse control problem that we characterize in terms of a quasi-variational system by dynamic programming methods. Calibration procedures are derived for estimating the transition matrix and intensity parameters for the spread and for Cox processes modelling the execution of limit orders. We provide an explicit backward splitting scheme for solving the problem and show how it can be reduced to a system of simple equations involving only the inventory and spread variables. Several computational tests are performed both on simulated and real data, and illustrate the impact and profit when considering execution priority in limit orders and market orders. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Applied mathematical finance; Market microstructure; Portfolio optimization; Quantitative finance techniques; Stochastic control; Trading strategies"

By “embedded” we mean that the optimization algorithm is part of a larger, fully automated system, that executes automatically with newly arriving data or changing conditions, and without any human intervention or action. By “real-time” we mean that the optimization algorithm executes much faster than a typical or generic method with a human in the loop, in times measured in milliseconds or microseconds for small and medium size problems, and (a few) seconds for larger problems. In real-time embedded convex optimization the same optimization problem is solved many times, with different data, often with a hard real-time deadline. In this chapter we propose an automatic code generation system for real-time embedded convex optimization. Such a system scans a description of the problem family, and performs much of the analysis and optimization of the algorithm, such as choosing variable orderings used with sparse factorizations and determining storage structures, at code generation time. Compiling the generated source code yields an extremely efficient custom solver for the problem family.

This paper proposes an expert system that uses novel machine learning techniques to predict the price return over these seasonal events, and then uses these predictions to develop a profitable trading strategy. While simple approaches to trading these regularities can prove profitable, such trading leads to potential large drawdowns (peak-to-trough decline of an investment measured as a percentage between the peak and the trough) in profit. In this paper, we introduce an automated trading system based on performance weighted ensembles of random forests that improves the profitability and stability of trading seasonality events. An analysis of various regression techniques is performed as well as an exploration of the merits of various techniques for expert weighting. The performance of the models is analysed using a large sample of stocks from the DAX. The results show that recency-weighted ensembles of random forests produce superior results in terms of both profitability and prediction accuracy compared with other ensemble techniques. It is also found that using seasonality effects produces superior results than not having them modelled explicitly. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose a simple model of latency arbitrage in which a single security is traded on two exchanges, with aggregate information available to regular traders only after some delay. An infinitely fast arbitrageur profits from market fragmentation by reaping the surplus when the two markets diverge due to this latency in cross-market communication. We develop a discrete-event simulation system to capture this processing and information transfer delay, and using an agent-based approach, we simulate the interactions between highfrequency and zero-intelligence trading agents at the millisecond level. We then evaluate allocative efficiency and market liquidity arising from the simulated order streams, and we find that market fragmentation and the presence of a latency arbitrageur reduces total surplus and negatively impacts liquidity. By replacing continuous-time markets with periodic call markets, we eliminate latency arbitrage opportunities and achieve further efficiency gains through the aggregation of orders over short time periods.

Such views have to be kept fresh at low maintenance cost and latencies. At the same time, these views have to support classical SQL, rather than window semantics, to enable applications that combine current with aged or historical data. In this paper, we present viewlet transforms, a recursive finite differencing technique applied to queries. The viewlet transform materializes a query and a set of its higher-order deltas as views. These views support each other's incremental maintenance, leading to a reduced overall view maintenance cost. The viewlet transform of a query admits efficient evaluation, the elimination of certain expensive query operations, and aggressive parallelization. We develop viewlet transforms into a workable query execution technique, present a heuristic and cost-based optimization framework, and report on experiments with a prototype dynamic data management system that combines viewlet transforms with an optimizing compilation technique.

Elasticity is the term coined to describe the capability of applications to change dynamically their resource usage in response to workload fluctuations. This paper focuses on strategies for elastic data stream processing targeting multicore systems. The key idea is to exploit Model Predictive Control, a control-theoretic method that takes into account the system behavior over a future time horizon in order to decide the best reconfiguration to execute. We design a set of energy-aware proactive strategies, optimized for throughput and latency QoS requirements, which regulate the number of used cores and the CPU frequency through the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) support offered by modern multicore CPUs. We evaluate our strategies in a high-frequency trading application fed by synthetic and real-world workload traces.

Alternating decision tree (ADT), which is implemented with Logitboost, was chosen as the underlying algorithm. One of the strengths of our approach is that the algorithm is able to select the best combination of rules derived from well-known technical analysis indicators and is also able to select the best parameters of the technical indicators. Additionally, the online learning layer combines the output of several ADTs and suggests a short or long position. Finally, the risk management layer can validate the trading signal when it exceeds a specified non-zero threshold and limit the application of our trading strategy when it is not profitable. We test the expert weighting algorithm with data of 100 randomly selected companies of the S & P 500 index during the period 2003-2005. We find that this algorithm generates abnormal returns during the test period. Our experiments show that the boosting approach is able to improve the predictive capacity when indicators are combined and aggregated as a single predictor.

The resulting fine-grain measurement demands cannot be met effectively by existing technologies, such as SNMP, NetFlow, or active probing. We propose instrumenting routers with a hash-based primitive that we call a Lossy Difference Aggregator (LDA) to measure latencies down to tens of microseconds and losses as infrequent as one in a million. Such measurement can be viewed abstractly as what we refer to as a coordinated streaming problem, which is fundamentally harder than standard streaming problems due to the need to coordinate values between nodes. We describe a compact data structure that efficiently computes the average and standard deviation of latency and loss rate in a coordinated streaming environment. Our theoretical results translate to an efficient hardware implementation at 40 Gbps using less than 1% of a typical 65-nm 400-MHz networking ASIC. When compared to Poisson-spaced active probing with similar overheads, our LDA mechanism delivers orders of magnitude smaller relative error; active probing requires 50-60 times as much bandwidth to deliver similar levels of accuracy.

RoxyBot faced two key technical challenges in TAG: (i) allocation-assigning purchased goods to clients at the end of a game instance so as to maximize total client utility, and (ii) completion-determining the optimal quantity of each resource to buy and sell given client preferences, current holdings, and market prices. For the dimensions of TAG, an optimal solution to the allocation problem is tractable, and RoxyBot uses a search algorithm based on Az.ast to produce optimal allocations.

This is especially important for computational finance, where digital traces of human behaviour offer a great potential to drive trading strategies. We contribute to this by providing a consistent approach that integrates various datasources in the design of algorithmic traders. This allows us to derive insights into the principles behind the profitability of our trading strategies. We illustrate our approach through the analysis of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency known for its large price fluctuations. In our analysis, we include economic signals of volume and price of exchange for USD, adoption of the Bitcoin technology and transaction volume of Bitcoin. We add social signals related to information search, word of mouth volume, emotional valence and opinion polarization as expressed in tweets related to Bitcoin for more than 3 years. Our analysis reveals that increases in opinion polarization and exchange volume precede rising Bitcoin prices, and that emotional valence precedes opinion polarization and rising exchange volumes. We apply these insights to design algorithmic trading strategies for Bitcoin, reaching very high profits in less than a year. We verify this high profitability with robust statistical methods that take into account risk and trading costs, confirming the long-standing hypothesis that trading-based social media sentiment has the potential to yield positive returns on investment. © 2015 The Authors.","Algorithmic trading; Bitcoin; Computational social science; Polarization; Prediction; Sentiment"

Reports frequently note that ‘power’ goes to those who gain relevant trading information in marketing channels. The paper then asks whether and how structured or ‘automated’ trading information exchanges (e.g. electronic data interchange (EDI) links) between suppliers and wholesalers impact on their bargaining power in grocery marketing channels. This paper starts with the view that automated information exchanges favour the suppliers because they obtain trading information and gain marketing flexibility more than the wholesalers do. Focusing on the perspective of grocery wholesalers, the paper examines the relationships between (1) EDI use, (2) suppliers’ incentives for EDI, (3) wholesalers’ perceived bargaining power and (4) trust and cooperation between wholesalers and suppliers. Based on exploratory survey data from 33 grocery wholesalers, the paper finds that automated information exchanges may lower wholesalers' perceived bargaining power. It also shows that an appropriate level of incentives from suppliers tends to compensate for the power loss.

However, these patterns are often elusive as they are affected by many uncertain political-economic factors in the real world, such as corporate performances, government policies, and even breaking news circulated across markets. Moreover, time series of stock prices are non-stationary and non-linear, making the prediction of future price trends much challenging. To address them, we propose a novel State Frequency Memory (SFM) recurrent network to capture the multi-frequency trading patterns from past market data to make long and short term predictions over time. Inspired by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the SFM decomposes the hidden states of memory cells into multiple frequency components, each of which models a particular frequency of latent trading pattern underlying the fluctuation of stock price. Then the future stock prices are predicted as a nonlinear mapping of the combination of these components in an Inverse Fourier Transform (IFT) fashion. Modeling multi-frequency trading patterns can enable more accurate predictions for various time ranges: while a shortterm prediction usually depends on high frequency trading patterns, a long-term prediction should focus more on the low frequency trading patterns targeting at long-term return. Unfortunately, no existing model explicitly distinguishes between various frequencies of trading patterns to make dynamic predictions in literature. The experiments on the real market data also demonstrate more competitive performance by the SFM as compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Multi-frequency trading patterns; State frequency memory; Stock price prediction"

The investigated method is used to determine potential buy and sell conditions for stocks, aiming to yield robust solutions able to withstand extreme market conditions, while producing high returns at a minimal risk. One of the biggest challenges GP evolved solutions face is over-fitting. GP trading rules need to have similar performance when tested with new data in order to be deployed in a real situation. We explore a random sampling method (RSFGP) which instead of calculating the fitness over the whole dataset, calculates it on randomly selected segments. This method shows improved robustness and out-of-sample results compared to standard genetic programming (SGP) and a volatility adjusted fitness (VAFGP).

These strategies are evaluated using 21 of the most liquid stocks of the Spanish market. The achieved results clearly outperform Buy&Hold, SGP and VAFGP. Additionally, the solutions obtained with the training data during the experiments clearly show during testing robustness to step market declines as seen during the European sovereign debt crisis experienced recently in Spain. In this paper the solutions learned were able to operate for prolonged periods, which demonstrated the validity and robustness of the rules learned, which are able to operate continuously and with minimal human intervention. To sum up, the developed method is able to evolve TSs suitable for all market conditions with promising results, which suggests great potential in the method generalization capabilities. The use of financial metrics alongside popular TI enables the system to increase the stock return while proving resilient through time. The RSFGP system is able to cope with different types of markets achieving a portfolio return of 31.81% for the testing period 2009-2013 in the Spanish market, having the IBEX35 index returned 2.67%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The STGP performance is compared with that of parametric and non-parametric models and validated by two formal empirical tests. We perform in-sample and out-of-sample comparisons between all models on the basis of forecast performance and investment return. Furthermore, our paper shows the relative strength of these models with respect to the actual trading profit generated by their forecasts. Empirical experiments suggest that the STGP forecasting technique significantly outperforms the traditional econometric models.

By means of multivariate statistical analysis and simulation studies, we analyze the influences of sample size (L) and input dimensionality on the accuracy of determining the portfolio weights. We find that degradation in portfolio performance due to inexact estimation of N means and N(N - 1)/2 correlations is proportional to N/L; however, estimation of N variances does not worsen the result. To reduce unhelpful sample size/dimensionality effects, we perform a clustering of N time series and split them into a small number of blocks. Each block is composed of mutually correlated ATSs. It generates an expert trading agent based on a nontrainable 1/ N portfolio rule. To increase the diversity of the expert agents, we use training sets of different lengths for clustering. In the output of the portfolio management system, the regularized mean-variance framework-based fusion agent is developed in each walk-forward step of an out-of-sample portfolio validation experiment.

This paper provides new insights into improving the time-varying risk-adjusted performance of trading systems controlled by Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (ANFIS) or Dynamic Evolving Neuro Fuzzy Systems (DENFIS). Contrary to most former studies which focus on daily predictions, we compare these models in an intraday stock trading scenario using high-frequency data. Firstly, we propose a dynamic extension of the popular moving average rule and enhance it with a model validation methodology using heat maps to analyse favourable profitability in specific holding time and signal regions. Secondly, we study the effect of realistic constraints such as transaction costs and intraday trading hours, which many existing approaches in the literature ignore. Thirdly, unlike most former studies that only aim to minimise statistical error measures, we compare this approach with financially more relevant risk-adjusted objective functions. To this end, we also consider an innovative ANFIS ensemble architecture which on an intraday level dynamically selects between different risk-adjusted models. Our study shows that accounting for transaction costs and the use of risk-return objective functions provide better results in out-of-sample tests. Overall, the ANN model is identified as a viable model, however ANFIS shows more stable time-varying performance across multiple market regimes. Moreover, we find that combining multiple risk-adjusted objective functions using an ANFIS ensemble yields promising results. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","ANFIS; ANFIS ensemble; ANN; DENFIS; Dynamic moving average; High-frequency trading"

Significant technological investments have led to dramatic improvements in latency, the delay between a trading decision and the resulting trade execution. We describe a theoretical model for the quantitative valuation of latency. Our model measures the trading frictions created by the presence of latency, by considering the optimal execution problem of a representative investor. Via a dynamic programming analysis, our model provides a closed-form expression for the cost of latency in terms of well-known parameters of the underlying asset. We implement our model by estimating the latency cost incurred by trading on a human time scale. Examining NYSE common stocks from 1995 to 2005 shows that median latency cost across our sample roughly tripled during this time period. Furthermore, using the same data set, we compute a measure of implied latency and conclude that the median implied latency decreased by approximately two orders of magnitude. Empirically calibrated, our model suggests that the reduction in cost achieved by going from trading on a human time scale to a low latency time scale is comparable with other execution costs faced by the most cost efficient institutional investors, and it is consistent with the rents that are extracted by ultra-low latency agents, such as providers of automated execution services or high frequency traders. © 2013 INFORMS.",

Using a correlation-based analysis approach, we find that in short time scales stocks have a stronger influence on the index.

This approach takes advantage of boosting's feature selection capability to select an optimal combination of technical indicators and design a new set of trading rules. We tested this approach with high-frequency data of the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index Futures (FESX) and the DAX Futures (FDAX) for March 2009. Our method was implemented with different learning algorithms and outperformed a combination of the same group of technical analysis indicators using the parameters typically recommended by practitioners. We incorporated this method of model calibration in a trading agent that relies on a layered structure consisting of the machine learning algorithm described above, an online learning utility, a trading strategy, and a risk management overlay. The online learning layer combines the output of several experts and suggests a short or long position. If the expected position is positive (negative), the trading agent sends a buy (sell) limit order at prices slightly lower (higher) than the bid price at the top of the buy (sell) order book less (plus) transaction costs. If the order is not 100% filled within a fixed period (i.e. 1 minute) of being issued, the existent limit orders are cancelled, and limit orders are reissued according to the new experts' forecast. As part of its risk management capability, the trading agent eliminates any weak trading signal.

An initial look at financial time series gives the impression that they are random in nature. If true, this would make the forecast, and therefore the trading, of such series exceptionally difficult.

This leads to the predictability of most financial time series as being a rather controversial issue. Experts have been forecasting and trading financial markets for decades, using their knowledge and expertise in recognizing patterns and interpreting current financial data. This paper extends the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System to create an expert system that is capable of using fuzzy reasoning combined with the pattern recognition capability of neural networks to be used in financial forecasting and trading. The novelty of the approach lies in its application to the field of high frequency finance. Such an approach has not been used so far with high frequency trading or as a part of an automated trading strategy. This has produced an expert trading system which overcomes the physical limitations of human experts and traders in taking multiple decisions at extremely short time intervals. This means the system can perform predictions and trading decisions at a very high frequency using intra-day data. © 2009 IEEE.","Efficient market hypothesis; Financial prediction; High frequency trading; Neuro-fuzzy inference system"

Therefore, using a physical time scale may expose companies to risks, due to ignorance of some significant activities. In this paper, an alternative and original approach is explored to capture important activities in the market. The main idea is to use an event-based time scale based on a new way of summarising data, called Directional Changes. Combined with a genetic algorithm, the proposed approach aims to find a trading strategy that maximises profitability in foreign exchange markets. In order to evaluate its efficiency and robustness, we run rigorous experiments on 255 datasets from six different currency pairs, consisting of intra-day data from the foreign exchange spot market. The results from these experiments indicate that our proposed approach is able to generate new and profitable trading strategies, significantly outperforming other traditional types of trading strategies, such as technical analysis and buy and hold. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithmic trading; Directional changes; Financial forecasting; Genetic algorithm"

The focus of the paper is on the relation between imitation and ignorance within the organizational structure of high-frequency trading (HFT) firms. In social studies of finance (SSF) literature imitation is considered a strategic act, i.e. imitation is a term applied when traders copy the strategies of other traders. I wish to turn this relation between ignorance and imitation on its head and consider ignorance itself as a strategic unknown and investigate the kinds of imitations that might be produced from structures of not-knowing (i.e. structures intended to divide, obscure and protect knowledge). This point is illustrated through ethnographic studies and interviews within five HFT firms. The data show how a black-box structure of ignorance is replicated within the organizational setting of these firms and re-enacted by the traders. Towards the end of the paper the politics of the relationship between imitation and ignorance is discussed. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","black box; high-frequency trading; ignorance; imitation; organizational structure; social studies of finance"

High-frequency trading data arrive at random times. By combining stochastic and agent-based approaches, we develop a model for trading time, trading volume, and price changes. We generate intertrade time (time between successive trades) Δ ti, and the number of shares traded q(Δ ti) as two independent but power-law autocorrelated processes, where Δ ti is subordinated to q(Δ ti), and Δ ti is more strongly correlated than q(Δ ti). These two power-law autocorrelated processes are responsible for the emergence of strong power-law correlations in (a) the total number of shares traded N(ΔT) and (b) the share volume Q ΔT calculated as the sum of the number of shares q i traded in a fixed time interval ΔT. We find that even though q(Δ ti) is weakly power-law correlated, due to strong power-law correlations in Δ ti, the (integrated) share volume Q(ΔT) ≡Σ ΔT i=1q(Δt i) exhibits strong long-range power-law correlations. We propose that intertrade times and bid-ask price changes share the same volatility mechanism, yielding the power-law autocorrelations in absolute values of price change and power-law tails in the distribution of price changes. The model generates the log-linear functional relationship between the average bid-ask spread 〈S〉 ΔT and the number of trade occurrences N ΔT, and between 〈S〉 ΔT and Q ΔT.

This paper demonstrates how solely relying on advances in computer hardware to accelerate market VaR estimation overlooks significant opportunities for acceleration. We use a simulation based delta-gamma Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimate and compute the loss function using basic linear algebra subroutines (BLAS). Our NVIDIA GeForce GTX280 graphics processing unit (GPU) based baseline implementation is a straight-forward port from the CPU implementation and only had a 8.21x speed advantage over a quadcore Intel Core2 Q9300 central processing unit (CPU) based implementation. We demonstrate three approaches to gain additional speedup over the baseline GPU implemention. Firstly, we reformulate the loss function to reduce the amount of necessary computation and achieved a 60.3x speedup. Secondly, we selected functionally equivalent distribution conversion modules to give the best convergence rate - providing an additional 2x speedup. Thirdly, we merged data-parallel computational kernels to remove redundant load store operations leading to an additional 1.85x speedup. Overall, we have achieved a speedup of 148x against the baseline GPU implementation, reducing the time of a VaR estimation with a standard error of 0.1% from minutes to less than one second.

HFT is often discussed as a purely technological development, where all that matters is the speed of allocating, processing and transmitting data. Indeed, the speed at which trades are executed and data transmitted is accelerating, and it is fair to say that algorithms are now the primary interacting agents operating in the financial markets. However, we contend that HFT is first and foremost a cultural phenomenon. More specifically, both individuals and collective agents – such as algorithms – might be considered cultural entities, charged with very different ways of processing information, making sense of it and turning it into knowledge and practice. This raises issues relating to situated knowledge, distributed cognition and action, the assignment of responsibility when regulating high-speed algorithms, their history, organizational structure and, perhaps more fundamentally, their representation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","algorithms; cultures; economic sociology; high-frequency trading; social studies of finance"

To satisfy the need, researchers have proposed new architectures such as LDA and RLI that can provide fine-grained latency measurements. However, these architectures are fundamentally ossified in their design as they are designed to provide only a specific pre-configured aggregate measurement - -either average latency across all packets (LDA) or per-flow latency measurements (RLI). Network operators, however, need latency measurements at both finer (e.g., packet) as well as flexible (e.g., flow subsets) levels of granularity. To bridge this gap, we propose an architecture called MAPLE that essentially stores packet-level latencies in routers and allows network operators to query the latency of arbitrary traffic sub-populations. MAPLE is built using scalable data structures with small storage needs (uses only 12.8 bits/packet), and uses a novel mechanism to reduce the query bandwidth significantly (by a factor of 17 compared to the naive method of sending packet queries individually). © 2012 ACM.","approximation; bloom filter; latency"

Whether VPIN is more strongly correlated with volume or volatility depends on the exact implementation. Hence, it is crucial for the interpretation of VPIN as a harbinger of market turbulence or as a predictor of short-term volatility to control for current volume and volatility. Doing so, we find no evidence of incremental predictive power of VPIN for future volatility. Likewise, VPIN does not attain unusual extremes prior to the flash crash. Moreover, the properties of VPIN are strongly dependent on the underlying trade classification. In particular, using more standard classification techniques, VPIN behaves in the exact opposite manner of what is portrayed in ELO (2011a, 2012a). At a minimum, ELO should rationalize this systematic reversal as the classification becomes more closely aligned with individual transactions.ELO (2014) dispute our findings. This note reviews the econometric methodology and the market microstructure arguments behind our conclusions and responds to a number of inaccurate assertions. In addition, we summarize fresh empirical evidence that corroborates the hypothesis that VPIN is largely driven, and significantly distorted, by the volume and volatility innovations. Furthermore, we note there is compelling new evidence that transaction-based classification schemes are more accurate than the bulk volume strategies advocated by ELO for constructing VPIN.

The scaling of the return with its standard deviation collapses the probabilities of all markets examined-and also for different time horizons-into single curves, suggesting that first-passage statistics is market independent (at least for high-frequency data). On the other hand, a very closely related quantity, the survival probability, shows, away from the center and tails of the distribution, a hyperbolic t -1 /2 decay typical of a Markovian dynamics, albeit the existence of memory in markets. Modifications of the Weibull and Student distributions are good candidates for the phenomenological description of first-passage time properties under certain regimes.

In real-time applications with streaming data two major issues that need particular care are the inefficiency of batch-mode learning, and the arduous task of training the learning machine in presence of non-stationary behavior. We tackle these issues in the context of algorithmic trading, where sequential decisions need to be made quickly as new data points arrive, and where the data generating process may change continuously with time. We propose a master algorithm that evolves a pool of on-line SVR experts and learns to trade by dynamically weighting the experts' opinions.

Innovative streaming applications are being developed in areas ranging from scientific applications (e.g., environment monitoring), to business intelligence (e.g., fraud detection and trend analysis), to financial markets (e.g., algorithmic trading strategies). Developing, understanding, debugging, and optimizing streaming applications is non-trivial because of the adaptive and dynamic nature of these applications. The sheer complexity and the distributed character of a large number of cooperating components hosted on a distributed environment further complicate matters. In this paper we describe Streamsight, a new visualization tool built to examine, monitor, and help understand the dynamic behavior of streaming applications. Previously developed stream processing visualization tools focus solely on composition of dataflow graphs. Streamsight's novelty hinges on a wide range of capabilities, including the ability to manage the dynamics of large and evolving topologies comprising multiple streaming applications with thousands of nodes and interconnections. From rendering live performance counters using different perspectives to allowing recordings and replays of the execution process, Streamsight provides the mechanisms that permit a better understanding of the evolving and adaptive behavior of streaming applications. These capabilities are used for debugging purposes, for performance optimization, and management of resources, including capacity planning.

Stream processing is one of the potential application scenarios of big data systems where the goal is to process a continuous, high velocity flow of information items. High frequency trading (HFT) in stock markets or trending topic detection in Twitter are some examples of stream processing applications. In some cases (like, for instance, in HFT), these applications have end-to-end quality-of-service requirements and may benefit from the usage of real-time techniques. Taking this into account, the present article analyzes, from the point of view of real-time systems, a set of patterns that can be used when implementing a stream processing application.

An important theory in financial markets is mean reversion, which plays a critical role in some state-of-the-art portfolio selection strategies. Although existing mean reversion strategies have been shown to achieve good empirical performance on certain datasets, they seldom carefully deal with noise and outliers in the data, leading to suboptimal portfolios, and consequently yielding poor performance in practice. In this paper, we propose to exploit the reversion phenomenon by using robust L 1 -median estimators, and design a novel online portfolio selection strategy named 'Robust Median Reversion' (RMR), which constructs optimal portfolios based on the improved reversion estimator. We examine the performance of the proposed algorithms on various real markets with extensive experiments. Empirical results show that RMR can overcome the drawbacks of existing mean reversion algorithms and achieve significantly better results. Finally, RMR runs in linear time, and thus is suitable for large-scale real-time algorithmic trading applications. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","L 1 -median; mean reversion; online learning; Portfolio selection; robust median reversion"

Identifying and understanding the impact of algorithmic trading on financial markets has become a critical issue for market operators and regulators. Advanced data feeds and audit trail information from market operators now allow for the full observation of market participants’ actions. A key question is the extent to which it is possible to understand and characterize the behaviour of individual participants from observations of trading actions. In this paper, we consider the basic problems of categorizing and recognizing traders (or, equivalently, trading algorithms) on the basis of observed limit orders. These problems are of interest to regulators engaged in strategy identification for the purposes of fraud detection and policy development. Methods have been suggested in the literature for describing trader behaviour using classification rules defined over a feature space consisting of summary trading statistics of volume and inventory, along with derived variables that reflect the consistency of buying or selling behaviour. Our principal contribution is to suggest an entirely different feature space that is constructed by inferring key parameters of a sequential optimization model that we take as a surrogate for the decision-making process of the traders. In particular, we model trader behaviour in terms of a Markov decision process. We infer the reward (or objective) function for this process from observations of trading actions using a process from machine learning known as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). The reward functions learned through IRL then constitute a feature space that can be the basis for supervised learning (for classification or recognition of traders) or unsupervised learning (for categorization of traders). Making use of a real-world data-set from the E-Mini futures contract, we compare two principal IRL variants, linear IRL and Gaussian Process IRL, against a method based on summary trading statistics. Results suggest that IRL-based feature spaces support accurate classification and meaningful clustering. Further, we argue that, because they attempt to learn traders’ underlying value propositions under different market conditions, the IRL methods are more informative and robust than the summary statistic-based approach and are well suited for discovering new behaviour patterns of market participants. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Algorithmic trading; Behavioural finance; Gaussian process; High-frequency trading; Inverse reinforcement learning; Markov decision process; Support vector machine"

For many years, many manifestations of TF such as a software program called Turtle Trader, for example, emerged in the industry. Surprisingly little has been studied in academic research about its algorithms and applications. Unlike financial forecasting, TF does not predict any market movement; instead it identifies a trend at early time of the day, and trades automatically afterwards by a pre-defined strategy regardless of the moving market directions during run time. Trend following trading has been popular among speculators. However it remains as a trading method where human judgment is applied in setting the rules (aka the strategy) manually. Subsequently the TF strategy is executed in pure objective operational manner. Finding the correct strategy at the beginning is crucial in TF. This usually involves human intervention in first identifying a trend, and configuring when to place an order and close it out, when certain conditions are met. In this paper, we evaluated and compared a collection of TF algorithms that can be programmed in a computer system for automated trading. In particular, a new version of TF called trend recalling model is presented. It works by partially matching the current market trend with one of the proven successful patterns from the past. Our experiments based on real stock market data show that this method has an edge over the other trend following methods in profitability. The results show that TF however is still limited by market fluctuation (volatility), and the ability to identify trend signal. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper highlights four properties of price-contingent trading that increase the frequency of such events. Price-contingent trading is common across financial market, since it includes algorithmic trading, technical trading, and dynamic option hedging. The four properties we consider are: (1) high kurtosis in the distribution of order sizes; (2) clustering of trades within the day; (3) clustering of trades at certain prices; and (4) feedback between trading and returns. The paper estimates the relative importance of these factors using data from the foreign exchange market. Calibrated simulations indicate that interactions among these factors are at least as important as any single one. Among individual factors, the orders' size distribution and feedback effects have the strongest influence. Overall, price-contingent trading could account for half of realized excess kurtosis.

It shows that securities markets are dominated by a cohort of ""structural insiders,"" namely a set of traders able to utilize close physical and informational access to trade at speeds measured in milliseconds and microseconds, a practice loosely termed high frequency trading (HFT). By virtue of speed and physical proximity to exchanges, these HFT traders can systematically gain frst access to new information, trade on it, and change prices before the rest of the market can see its content. This Article makes three contributions. First, it introduces and develops the concept of structural insider trading. Securities markets increasingly rely on automated traders utilizing algorithms- or pre-programmed electronic instructions-for trading. Policy allows traders to enjoy important structural advantages: (i) to physically locate on or next to an exchange, shortening the time it takes for information to travel to and from the marketplace; and (ii) to receive feeds of richly detailed data directly to these co-located trading operations. With algorithms sophisticated enough to respond instantly and independently to new information, co-located automated traders can receive and trade on not-fully-public information ahead of other investors. Indeed, by the time that the rest of the market sees this information, it has long since become out-of-date. Secondly, this Article shows that structural insider trading exhibits harms that are substantially similar to those regulated under conventional theories of corporate insider trading. Structural insiders place other investors at a persistent informational disadvantage. Through their frst sight of marketmoving data, structural insiders can capture the best trades and Erode the profts of informed traders, reducing their incentives to participate in the marketplace. Despite the similarity in harms, however, this Article shows that current doctrine does not apply to restrict structural insider trading. Rather, structural insiders thrive in full public view, and with regulatory permission. Thirdly, this Article explores the implications of structural insider trading for the theory and doctrine of insider trading. It shows them to be increasingly incoherent in their application. In protecting investors against one set of insiders but not another, law and policy appear under profound strain in the face of innovative markets.",

This protocol can be applied wherever a prediction-based service must be provided timely for each data point of a multitude of high frequency data streams, each of which is observed at a local node of some distributed system. Exemplary applications include social content recommendation and algorithmic trading. The challenge is to balance the joint predictive performance of the nodes by exchanging information between them, while not letting communication overhead deteriorate the responsiveness of the service. Technically, the proposed protocol is based on controlling the variance of the local models in a decentralized way. This approach retains the asymptotic optimal regret of previous algorithms. At the same time, it allows to substantially reduce network communication, and, in contrast to previous approaches, it remains applicable when the data is non-stationary and shows rapid concept drift. We demonstrate empirically that the protocol is able to hold up a high predictive performance using only a fraction of the communication required by benchmark methods. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",

The theoretical justification for our solution is based on multivariate statistical analysis of multidimensional investment tasks, particularly on relations between data size, algorithm complexity and portfolio efficacy. To reduce the dimensionality/sample size problem, a larger task is broken down into smaller parts by means of item similarity - clustering. Similar problems are given to smaller groups to solve. Groups, however, vary in many aspects. Pseudo randomly-formed groups compose a large number of modules of feed-forward decision-making systems. The evolution mechanism forms collections of the best modules for each single short time period. Final solutions are carried forward to the global scale where a collection of the best modules is chosen using a multiclass cost-sensitive perceptron. Collected modules are combined in a final solution in an equally weighted approach (1/N Portfolio). The efficacy of the novel decision-making approach was demonstrated through a financial portfolio optimization problem, which yielded adequate amounts of real world data. For portfolio construction, we used 11,730 simulated trading robot performances. The dataset covered the period from 2003 to 2012 when environmental changes were frequent and largely unpredictable.

Price movement was examined in trade-by-trade (tick) data along with temporal timespans between 1 s to 30 min for 52 one-week periods for one highly-traded stock. We hypothesize that much of the initial predictability of trade-by-trade (tick) data is due to traditional market dynamics, or the bouncing of the price between the stock's bid and ask. Only after timespans of between 5 to 10 s does this cease to explain the predictability; after this timespan, two consecutive movements in the same direction occur with higher probability than that of movements in the opposite direction.

These Algorithmic Trading engines enable order submissions without human intervention based on quantitative models applying historical and real-time market data. Although there is a widespread discussion on the pros and cons of Algorithmic Trading and on its impact on market volatility and market quality, little is known on how algorithms actually place their orders in the market and whether and in which respect this differs form other order submissions. Based on a dataset that - for the first time - includes a specific flag to enable the identification of orders submitted by Algorithmic Trading engines, the paper investigates the extent of Algorithmic Trading activity and specifically their order placement strategies in comparison to human traders in the Xetra trading system. It is shown that Algorithmic Trading has become a relevant part of overall market activity and that Algorithmic Trading engines fundamentally differ from human traders in their order submission, modification and deletion behavior as they exploit real-time market data and latest market movements.","Algorithmic trading; Electronic markets; Order submission; Securities trading"

Aiming at solving this problem, an online evolving fuzzy rule-based prediction model is proposed in this paper. Because this prediction model is based on evolving fuzzy rule-based systems and a novel, simpler form of data density, it can autonomously learn from the live data stream, automatically build/remove its rules and recursively update the parameters. This model responds quickly to all unpredictable sudden changes of financial data and re-adjusts itself to follow the new data pattern.

However, the cost of the parallelization process of existing applications is still too high in terms of time-to-development, and often requires a large effort and expertise by the programmer. The REPARA methodology consists in a systematic way to express parallel patterns by annotating the source code using C++11 attributes transformed automatically in a target parallel code based on parallel programming libraries (e.g. FastFlow, Intel TBB). In this paper we apply this approach in the parallelization of a real high-frequency trading application.

The associated 'technological arms race' has created a new market ecology which has made trading cheaper and faster but more volatile and fragmented. This paper charts the technological roots of this transformation from a conventional measurement of innovation perspective. We do so by employing content analysis techniques and extracting market infrastructure patent counts from the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) database for the period January 1976 to October 2013. From the resulting time series and a qualitative examination of patents we find that (1) the number of market infrastructure patents has dramatically increased since 1999, as confirmed by an associated structural break; (2) the new market ecology has, in true Schumpeterian style, been associated with a new breed of firms, most notably software firms and historically smaller brokerage firms that have invested heavily in technology internally and through strategic acquisitions; and (3) some incumbent firms have responded aggressively to the new market ecology, most notably the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Goldman Sachs. We conclude that policymakers, regulators and academics wishing to further investigate the technological roots of recent changes in capital should refer to patent data. Our principal contribution is to highlight that Wall Street has been actively patenting market infrastructure innovations in a pattern consistent with claims that an associated 'technological arms race' started in the late 1990s. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Capital markets; Financial innovation; High frequency trading; Patents"

We provide a model-free option pricing approach with neural networks, which can be applied to real-time pricing and hedging of FX options. In contrast to well-known theoretical models, an essential advantage of our approach is the simultaneous pricing across different strike prices and parsimonious use of real-time input variables. To test its ability for the purpose of high-frequency trading, we perform an empirical run-time trading simulation with a tick dataset of EUR/USD options on currency futures of 4 weeks. In very short non-overlapping 15-minute out-of-sample intervals, theoretical option prices derived from the Black model compete against nonparametric option prices through two different neural network topologies. We show that the approximated pricing function of learning networks is suitable for generating fast run-time option pricing evaluation as their performance is slightly better in comparison to theoretical prices. The derivation of the network function is also useful for performing hedging strategies. We conclude that the performance of closed-form pricing models depends highly on the volatility estimator, whereas neural networks can avoid this estimation problem but require market liquidity for training. Nevertheless, we also have to take particular enhancements into account, which give us useful hints for further research and steps.

Information systems have often been applied to support investors by forecasting price changes in securities markets. In addition to the asset price, liquidity represents another financial variable that has a high relevance for investors because it constitutes a main determinant of total transaction costs. Previous research has shown that the level of liquidity is affected by the publication of corporate disclosures. To derive an optimal order execution strategy that minimises the transaction costs, investors as well as automated trading engines must be able to anticipate changes in the available market liquidity. However, there is no research on how to forecast the impact of corporate disclosures on market liquidity. Therefore, we propose an IT artefact that allows automated trading engines to appropriately react to news-related liquidity shocks. The system indicates whether the publication of a regulatory corporate disclosure will be followed by a positive liquidity shock, i.e.; lower transaction costs compared to historical levels. Utilising text mining techniques, the content of the corporate disclosures is analysed to generate a trading signal. Furthermore, the trading signal is evaluated within a simulation-based use case that considers English and German corporate disclosures and is shown to be of economic value. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Automated trading; e-Finance; Forecasting; Liquidity; Simulation; Text mining"

When we correct for data snooping by applying the SSPA test on double-or-out market timing strategies, no single candlestick rule beats the buy-and-hold strategy after transaction costs. We also design fully automated trading systems by combining the best-performing candlestick rules. No evidence of out-performance is found after transaction costs.

We argue that the RRL is not sufficiently equipped to capture the non-linearities and structural breaks present in financial data, and propose the TRRL model as a more suitable algorithm for such environments. This paper gives a detailed description of the TRRL and compares its performance with that of the basic RRL model in a simple automated trading framework using daily data from four well-known European indices.

In view of the intensive computational needs, it is common to use machine learning approaches on Sharpe ratio maximization for implementing dynamic portfolio optimization. In the literature, return-based approaches which directly used security prices or returns to control portfolio weights were often used. Inspired by the arbitrage pricing theory (APT), some other efforts concentrate on indirect modelling using hidden factors. On the other hand, with regard to the proper risk measure in the Sharpe ratio, downside risk was considered a better substitute for variance. In this paper, we investigate how the Gaussian temporal factor analysis (TFA) technique can be used for portfolio optimization. Since TFA is based on the classical APT model and has the benefit of removing rotation indeterminacy via temporal modelling, using TFA for portfolio management allows portfolio weights to be indirectly controlled by several hidden factors. Moreover, we extend the approach to some other variants tailored for investors according to their investment objectives and degree of risk tolerance. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Based on these empirical findings, we introduce and calibrate a Markov chain-modulated pure jump model of price, spread, LO and MO arrivals and volume imbalance. As an application of the model, we pose and solve a stochastic control problem for an agent who maximizes terminal wealth, subject to inventory penalties, by executing trades using LOs.

This research study uses the multiple kernel learning technique to effectively combine information extracted from stock-specific and sub-industry-specific news articles for prediction of an upcoming price movement. News articles are divided into these two categories based on their relevance to a targeted stock and analyzed by separate kernels. The experimental results show that utilizing two categories of news improves the prediction accuracy in comparison with methods based on a single news category. © 2015 IEEE.","financial news; multiple kernel learning; stock price prediction; text mining"

The interest in news analytics is related to the ability to predict changes of prices, volatility and trading volume on the stock market. The emphasis of the paper is on assessing the added value of using news analytics data in improving the explanatory power of the GARCH-Jump model. Based on empirical evidences for some of FTSE100 companies, the paper examines two GARCH models with jumps. First we consider the well-known GARCH model with autoregressive conditional jump intensity proposed in [1]. Then we introduce the GARCH-Jumps model augmented with news intensity and obtain some empirical results. The main assumption of the model is that jump intensity might change over time and that jump intensity depends linearly on the number of news (the news intensity). The comparison of the values of log likelihood supports the hypothesis of impact of news on the jump intensity of volatility.","GARCH models; News analytics; Stock volatility modelling"

This observation clearly shows that for high-frequency trading, investors rely on previous price movements in making future investment decisions. We provide clear evidence that market and limit orders flows are much more predictable if those orders are submitted to close an existing position than if they are used to open one.

NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has referred to such fast data feeds as “Insider Trading 2.0”. For example, Thomson Reuters sold the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index to computerized trading firms 2 seconds before releasing its data to its other paying clients. This paper explores the ethical issues involved in the sale of such information. Is selling faster access ethically the same as traditional insider trading, which generally involves a breach of fiduciary duty or the use of misappropriated information? Such practices are extremely different from traditional insider trading as there is neither a breach of fiduciary duty nor misappropriation of inside information. The ethical issues are similar to other market segmentation and price discrimination issues, in which different prices are charged to different customers. The ability to price discriminate across segments can actually benefit large segments of the population who may receive lower prices because others, such as the high-speed traders, are paying more. The sale of faster access to information, especially by exchanges, raises additional ethical issues. There may be adverse effects on market quality that must be addressed. The moral distaste for the practice expressed by some stems from the seeming unfairness of a modern market structure that provides advantages to a small group of computerized traders. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Consumer Sentiment Index; High-frequency trading; Insider trading; Market segmentation; Price discrimination"

In this work, we examine the efficacy and the feasibility of developing a stacked generalization system, intelligently combining the predictions of diverse machine learning models. Our approach establishes a novel inferential framework that comprises the following levels of data processing: (i) We model the dependence patterns between major currency pairs via a diverse set of commonly used machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), Bayesian autoregressive trees (BART), dense-layer neural networks (NNs), and naïve Bayes (NB) classifiers. (ii) We generate implied signals of exchange rate fluctuation, based on the output of these models, as well as appropriate side information obtained by analyzing the correlations across currency pairs in our training datasets. (iii) We finally combine these implied signals into an aggregate predictive waveform, by leveraging majority voting, genetic algorithm optimization, and regression weighting techniques. We thoroughly test our framework in real-world trading scenarios; we show that our system leads to significantly better trading performance than the considered benchmarks.

In fields such as high frequency trading, as well as in many data centers, latency translates easily to financial losses. Research to date has focused on specific contributions to latency: from improving latency within the network to latency control on the application level. This paper takes an holistic approach to latency, and aims to provide a break-down of end-to-end latency from the application level to the wire. Using a set of crafted experiments, we explore the many contributors to latency. We assert that more attention should be paid to the latency within the host, and show that there is no silver bullet to solve the end-to-end latency challenge in data centers.

Skyline queries are a notable example. Their results consist of all the tuples whose attribute vector is not dominated (in the Pareto sense) by one of any other tuple. Because of their popularity, skyline queries have been studied in terms of both sequential algorithms and parallel implementations for multiprocessors and clusters. Within the Data Stream Processing paradigm, traditional database queries on static relations have been revised in order to operate on continuous data streams. Most of the past papers propose sequential algorithms for continuous skyline queries, whereas there exist very few works targeting implementations on parallel machines. This paper contributes to fill this gap by proposing a parallel implementation for multicore architectures. We propose (i) a parallelization of the eager algorithm based on the notion of Skyline Influence Time, (ii) optimizations of the reduce phase and load-balancing strategies to achieve near-optimal speedup, and (iii) a set of experiments with both synthetic benchmarks and a real dataset in order to show our implementation effectiveness.

We employ a simple model of latency arbitrage in which a single security is traded on two exchanges, with price quotes available to regular traders only after some delay. An infinitely fast arbitrageur reaps profits when the two markets diverge due to this latency in cross-market communication. Using an agent-based approach, we simulate interactions between high-frequency and zero-intelligence trading agents. From simulation data over a large space of strategy combinations, we estimate game models and compute strategic equilibria in a variety of market environments. We then evaluate allocative efficiency and market liquidity in equilibrium, and we find that market fragmentation and the presence of a latency arbitrageur reduces total surplus and negatively impacts liquidity. By replacing continuous-time markets with periodic call markets, we eliminate latency arbitrage opportunities and achieve further efficiency gains through the aggregation of orders over short time periods. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.","Agent-based simulation; High-frequency trading; Latency arbitrage"

This allows for multi-scale analysis of financial data. In the light of this, this paper formulates DC event approach into three automated trading strategies for investments in the FMs: ZI-Directional Change Trading (DCT0), DCT1, and DCT2. The main idea is to use intrinsic time scale based on DC events to learn the size and the direction of periodic patterns from the asset price historical dataset. Using simulation models of Saudi Stock Market, we evaluate the returns of the automated DC trading strategies. The analysis revealed interesting results and evidence that the proposed strategies can indeed generate effective trading for investors with a high rate of returns. The results of this study can be used further to develop decision support systems and autonomous trading agent strategies for the FM. © 2016, Econjournals.

Feed messages are often used in time-critical automated trading applications, and two identical feeds (A and B feeds) are provided in order to reduce message loss. A key challenge is to support A/B line arbitration efficiently to compensate for missing packets, while offering flexibility for various operational modes such as prioritising for low latency or for high data reliability. This paper presents a reconfigurable acceleration approach for A/B arbitration operating at the network level, capable of supporting any messaging protocol. Two modes of operation are provided simultaneously: one prioritising low latency, and one prioritising high reliability with three dynamically configurable windowing methods. We also present a model for message feed processing latencies that is useful for evaluating scalability in future applications. We outline a new low latency, high throughput architecture and demonstrate a cycle-accurate testing framework to measure the actual latency of packets within the FPGA. We implement and compare the performance of the NASDAQ TotalView-ITCH, OPRA and ARCA market data feed protocols using a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA. For high reliability messages we achieve latencies of 42ns for TotalView-ITCH and 36.75ns for OPRA and ARCA. 6ns and 5.25ns are obtained for low latency messages. The most resource intensive protocol, TotalView-ITCH, is also implemented in a Xilinx Virtex- 5 FPGA within a network interface card; it is used to validate our approach with real market data. We offer latencies 10 times lower than an FPGA-based commercial design and 4.1 times lower than the hardware-accelerated IBM PowerEN processor, with throughputs more than double the required 10Gbps line rate.

We analyze a structural model of optimal order placement that captures trade-off between the costs and benefits of order display. For a benchmark model of pure liquidity competition, we give a closed-form solution for optimal display sizes. We show that competition in liquidity supply incentivizes the use of hidden orders to prevent losses due to over-bidding. Thus, because aggressive liquidity competition is more prevalent in liquid stocks, our model predicts that the proportion of hidden liquidity is higher in liquid markets. Our theoretical considerations ares supported by an empirical analysis using high-frequency order-message data from NASDAQ. We find that there are no benefits in hiding orders in il-liquid stocks, whereas the performance gains can be significant in liquid stocks. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Hidden liquidity; High-frequency trading; Limit order book; Liquidity competition; Market impact; Order flow dynamics"

FPGA cards are widely used to reduce latency and accelerate market data processing. To create a low latency trading system, it is crucial to effectively build a representation of the market state (book) in hardware. Thus, we have designed a new hardware architecture, which updates the book with the best bid/offer prices based on the incoming messages from the exchange. For each message a corresponding financial instrument needs to be looked up and its record needs to be updated. Proposed architecture is utilizing cuckoo hashing for the book handling, which enables low latency symbol lookup and high memory utilization. In this paper we discuss a trade-off between lookup latency and memory utilization. With average latency of 253 ns the proposed architecture is able to handle 119 275 instruments while using only 144 Mbit QDR SRAM. © 2014 IEEE.",

Disturbingly, we show that the reference algorithms presented in the literature are ambiguous, thus reducing the validity of strict comparative studies. As a remedy, we suggest disambiguated standard implementations of AA and ZIP. Using Exchange Portal (ExPo), an open-source financial exchange simulation platform designed for realtime behavioural economic experiments involving human traders and/or trader-agents, we study the effects of disambiguating AA and ZIP, before introducing a novel method of assignment-adaptation (ASAD).

For instance, some investors prefer to have a lower bound risk rather than gaining a higher return. In portfolio theory, it is commonly assumed the existence of one risk free asset that offers a positive return. This theoretical risk free asset combined with a risky portfolio creates a new portfolio that presents a linear relation between risk and return as the risk free asset weight (w f ) changes. Hence, any level of risk or of return is easy to achieve separately, just by changing w f . However, in a world without any risk free assets, the combination between assets creates nonlinear portfolios. Achieving a specific level of risk or return is not a trivial task. In this paper, we assume a risky world rather than the existence of a risk free asset, in order to model an automated asset management system. Furthermore, some automated asset managers give very different results when evolving in different contexts: hence, a very profitable manager can have very bad results in other market situations. This paper presents a multiagent architecture, aiming to tackle these problems. The architecture, named COAST (COmpetitive Agent SocieTy), is based on competitive agents that act autonomously on behalf of an investor in financial asset management. It allows the simultaneous and competitive use of several asset analysis techniques currently applied in the finance field. Some dedicated agents, called advisors, apply a particular technique to a single asset. The results provided by these advisors are then submitted to and analyzed by a special agent called coach, who evaluates its advisors' performance and defines an expectation about the future price of one specific asset. Within COAST, several coaches negotiate to define the best money allocation among different assets, by using a negotiation protocol defined in this paper. We also propose an investor description model that is able to represent different investors' preferences with defined acceptable limits of risk and/or return. The COAST architecture was designed to operate adequately with any possible investor's preference. It was implemented using a financial market simulator called AgEx and tested using real data from the Nasdaq stock exchange. The test results show that the architecture performed well when compared to an adjusted market index. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Automated asset management; Automated trading; Multiagent architectures; Multiagent systems"

These changes occurred earlier for NASDAQ stocks (primarily between 1994 and 2004) and later for NYSE-listed stocks (mostly following Reg NMS and the 2006 introduction of the NYSE hybrid market). This paper surveys the evidence of how these changes impacted market quality and shows that overall market quality has improved significantly, including bid-ask spreads, liquidity, and transitory price impacts (measured by short-term variance ratios). The greater improvement in market quality for NYSE-listed stocks relative to NASDAQ stocks beginning in 2006 suggests causal links between the staggered market structure changes and market quality. Using proprietary data sets, provided by two exchanges, that identify the activity of high frequency trading firms, studies show these firms contributed directly to narrowing bid-ask spreads, increasing liquidity, and reducing intraday transitory pricing errors and intraday volatility.

With the rapid increases in algorithmic or high frequency trading in which trader make trading decisions by analyzing data patterns rather than fundamental factors affecting stock prices, both technical analyses and time series analyses become more relevant. In this study the authors apply the traditional time series decomposition (TSD), Holt/Winters (H/W) models, Box-Jenkins (B/J) methodology, and neural network (NN) to 50 randomly selected stocks from September 1, 1998 to December 31, 2010 with a total of 3105 observations for each company's close stock price. This sample period covers high tech boom and bust, the historical 9/11 event, housing boom and bust, and the recent serious recession and current slow recovery. During this exceptionally uncertain period of global economic and financial crises, it is expected that stock prices are extremely difficult to predict. All three time series approaches fit the data extremely well with R2 being around 0.995. For the hold-out period or out-of-sample forecasts over 60 trading days, the forecasting errors measured in terms of mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) are lower for B/J, H/W, and normalized NN model, but forecasting errors are quite large for time series decomposition and non-normalized NN models. © Kuo-Cheng Tseng, Ojoung Kwon, Luna C.

In this paper, we present a multiagent system composed by several autonomous analysts that use fundamentalist information in their reasoning process. These fundamentalist information are composed by company profit, dividends, data related to the company economic sector among others. This kind of information is rarely used on autonomous trading, because most of the agents deal only with technical information, which is composed by price and volume time series. Furthermore, we do not find a open source stock market simulator with support to fundamentalist trader agents. We then created a significantly extended version of the open source financial market simulation tool, called AgEx. This designed version provides also fundamentalist information about the trader's assets. As well as, makes more efficient the exchange of messages within AgEx. This efficiency allows traders that may submit orders in very short intervals of just some seconds or even some fraction of second, to use AgEx as a test platform. Using this new version of AgEx, we implemented and tested the multiagent system based on fundamentalist agents, that we call FAS.

Trading strategies have been proposed and practiced from the perspectives of Artificial Intelligence, market making, external information feedback, and technical analysis among others. This paper examines two automated stock-trading agents in the context of the Penn-Lehman Automated Trading (PLAT) simulator [1], which is a real-time, real-data market simulator. The first agent devises a market-making strategy exploiting market volatility without predicting the exact direction of the stock price movement. The second agent uses technical analysis. It might seem natural to buy when the market is on the rise and sell when it's on the decline, but the second agent does exactly the opposite. As a result, we call it the reverse strategy. The strategies used by both agents are adapted for automated trading. Both agents performed well in a PLAT live competition.

However, there are only very few works considering the stability of the EFSs, and these studies were limited to certain types of membership functions with specifically predefined parameters, which largely increases the complexity of the learning process. At the same time, stability analysis is of paramount importance for control applications and provides the theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the learning algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the stability proof of a class of EFSs based on data clouds, which are grounded at the AnYa type fuzzy systems and the recently introduced empirical data analytics (EDA) methodological framework. By employing data clouds, the class of EFSs of AnYa type considered in this paper avoids the traditional way of defining membership functions for each input variable in an explicit manner and its learning process is entirely data driven. The stability of the considered EFS of AnYa type is proven through the Lyapunov theory, and the proof of stability shows that the average identification error converges to a small neighborhood of zero. Although, the stability proof presented in this paper is specially elaborated for the considered EFS, it is also applicable to general EFSs. The proposed method is illustrated with Box-Jenkins gas furnace problem, one nonlinear system identification problem, Mackey-Glass time series prediction problem, eight real-world benchmark regression problems as well as a high-frequency trading prediction problem. Compared with other EFSs, the numerical examples show that the considered EFS in this paper provides guaranteed stability as well as a better approximation accuracy. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","AnYa type fuzzy systems; data clouds; evolving fuzzy systems (EFSs); stability"

This formulation allows the study of how the optimal order placement decision depends on the interplay between the state of order books, the fee structure, order flow properties and the aversion to execution risk. In the case of a single exchange, we derive an explicit solution for the optimal split between limit and market orders. For the general case of order placement across multiple exchanges, we propose a stochastic algorithm that computes the optimal routing policy and study the sensitivity of the solution to various parameters.

The results were then compared to those of an agent operating chaotically. Moreover, the existing significant cycles were found using more precise methods, suggested in the research, and based on the results of an agent buying and selling on all possible periods and phases. It has been analysed whether these really existing cycles were in accordance with the significant cycles resulting from the Fourier analysis.

One natural question, which has begun to spur the development of new models, is the effect of competition between platforms that use these two different mechanisms when agents can strategize over platform choice. In this paper we contribute to this nascent literature by developing an agent-based model of competition between a Call market and a CDA market. Our model incorporates patient informed traders (both high-frequency and not) who are willing to wait for order execution at their preferred price and impatient background traders who demand immediate execution. We show that there is a strong tendency for the Call market to absorb a significant fraction of trade under most equilibrium and approximate-equilibrium conditions.

The expansion of online financial news sources, such as Internet news and social media sources, provides instantaneous access to financial news. Commercial agencies have started developing their own filtered financial news feeds, which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. In this chapter, we use a high-frequency sentiment series, developed by TRNA, to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for DJIA stock index component companies. A variety of forms of this measure, namely, basic scores, absolute values of the series, squared values of the series, and the first differences of the series, are used to estimate three standard volatility models, namely, GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic), EGARCH (Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasctic), and GJR (Glosten, Jagganathan and Rundle (1993)). We use these alternative daily DJIA market sentiment scores to examine the relationship between financial news sentiment scores and the volatility of the DJIA return series. We demonstrate how this calibration of machine-filtered news can improve volatility measures. © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Conditional volatility models; DJIA; Sentiment scores; TRNA"

Our estimation procedure is based only on a preestimation of the Fourier coefficients of the volatility process. This approach constitutes a novelty in comparison with the nonparametric leverage estimators proposed in the literature, generally based on a preestimation of spot volatility, and it can be directly applied to estimate the leverage effect in the case of irregular trading observations and in the presence of microstructure noise contaminations, that is, in a high-frequency framework.

In this article, we focus on the portfolio allocation problem using high-frequency financial data, and propose a hybrid parallelization solution to carry out efficient asset allocations in a large portfolio via intra-day high-frequency data.

Our numerical studies are based on high-frequency price data on stocks traded in New York Stock Exchange in 2011. The analysis results show that portfolios constructed using high-frequency approach generally perform well by pooling together the strengths of regularization and estimation from a risk management perspective.

The questions rise if high frequency trading (HFT) provides more efficient, liquid markets and is economically beneficial. In this paper an algorithm based on statistical arbitrage is tested. Statistical arbitrage is a well-known trading strategy where profit arises from pricing inefficiencies between correlated financial instruments. An algorithm of statistical arbitrage tries to find a pair of correlated instruments that move together and take long/short positions when they diverge abnormally, hoping that the prices will converge in the near future. Recent computational expansion in financial modeling and the ever increasing demand for order execution speed is moving market making and price discovery strategies into high frequency trading (HFT) or the milliseconds realm, where HFT already generates nearly 2/3 of the overall trading volume. In this report we apply high frequency data from NYMEX exchange to test a trading system based on statistical arbitrage in one of the most liquid futures market, i.e. natural gas futures.

In closed systems - such as those found in HPC - Infiniband, iWARP or RoCE are common choices as system architects have the opportunity to choose the best host configurations and networking fabric. However, the vast majority of networks are built upon Ethernet with nodes exchanging data using the standard TCP/IP stack. On such networks, achieving ultra low-latency while maintaining compatibility with a standard TCP/IP stack is crucial. To date, most efforts for low-latency packet transfers have focused on three main areas: (i) avoiding context switches, (ii) avoiding buffer copies, and (iii) off-loading protocol processing. This paper describes IBM PowerENTM and its networking stack, showing that an integrated system design which treats Ethernet adapters as first class citizens that share the system bus with CPUs and memory, rather than as peripheral PCI Express attached devices, is a winning solution for achieving minimal latency. The work presents outstanding performance figures, including 1.30μs from wire to wire for UDP, usually the chosen protocol for latency sensitive applications, and excellent latency and bandwidth figures for the more complex TCP. © 2013 IEEE.",

Now trading is increasingly done in anonymous electronic markets where traders do not have designated functions or mandatory roles. In fact, the traders themselves have been replaced by algorithms (machines) operating with little or no human oversight. While the process of electronic trading is not visible to a human eye, machine-learning methods have been developed to recognize persistent patterns in the data. In this study, we develop a dynamic machine-learning method that designates traders in an anonymous electronic market into five persistent categories: high frequency traders, market makers, opportunistic traders, fundamental traders, and small traders.

They are widely used in high-frequency trading, seismic analysis and neuroscience. A critical numerical calculation in Hawkes process models is parameter estimation, which is used to fit a Hawkes process model to a data set. The parameter estimation problem can be solved by searching for a parameter set that maximises the log-likelihood. A core operation of this search process, the log-likelihood evaluation, is computationally demanding if the number of data points is large. To accelerate the computation, we present a log-likelihood evaluation strategy which is suitable for hardware acceleration.

All models were configured as binary classifiers, using a simple buy-and-hold trading strategy, and followed a supervised training scheme.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were subjected to the same data sets in order to benchmark HTM performance. The results suggest that the HTM technology can be used together with a feature vector of technical indicators to create a profitable trading algorithm for financial markets.

Stream processing is a paradigm well-suited for many modern data processing systems that ingest high-volume data streams from the real world, such as audio/video streaming, high-frequency trading, and security monitoring. One attractive property of stream processing is that it lends itself to parallelization on multicores, and even to distribution on clusters when extreme scale is required. Stream processing has been co-evolved by several communities, leading to diverse languages with similar core concepts. Providing a common execution environment reduces language development effort and increases portability. We designed River as a practical realization of Brooklet, a calculus for stream processing. So at another level, this paper is about a journey from theory (the calculus) to practice (the execution environment). The challenge is that, by definition, a calculus abstracts away all but the most central concepts. Hence, there are several research questions in concretizing the missing parts, not to mention a significant engineering effort in implementing them. But the effort is well worth it, because using a calculus as a foundation yields clear semantics and proven correctness results.

It guarantees that all resources are fairly distributed among agents respecting their own preferences. This article shows first that the computation of this welfare is a difficult problem, contrary to common intuition. Many counter-examples describe the pitfalls of this resolution.

These algorithms are usually referred as technical analysis. However, traders prefer to use a combination of several algorithms as indicators, rather than choosing a single one. The several signals provided are used to determine the trader order to buy or sell some stocks, or even to decide to not submit any order. In the last years, some researchers have tried to create new algorithms with learning skills in order to produce autonomous automatic traders, some of them using AI techniques. Inspired by the human traders' decision processes, our architectural approach composes heterogeneous autonomous trader agents in a competitive multiagent system. This architecture allows the use of several algorithms, based on different technical analysis indexes to manage portfolios. We have implemented this architecture and we have performed a set of simulation experiments using real-data from NASDAQ stock market. The experimental results were compared to the performance of single agents playing alone, and a better global performance was observed when traders compete with each other for resources.

Successful real human traders, and advanced automated algorithmic trading systems, learn from experience and adapt over time as market conditions change; our DLNN learns to copy this adaptive trading behavior. A novel aspect of our work is that we do not involve the conventional approach of attempting to predict time-series of prices of tradeable securities. Instead, we collect large volumes of training data by observing only the quotes issued by a successful sales-trader in the market, details of the orders that trader is executing, and the data available on the LOB (as would usually be provided by a centralized exchange) over the period that the trader is active. In this paper we demonstrate that suitably configured DLNNs can learn to replicate the trading behavior of a successful adaptive automated trader, an algorithmic system previously demonstrated to outperform human traders. We also demonstrate that DLNNs can learn to perform better (i.e., more profitably) than the trader that provided the training data. We believe that this is the first ever demonstration that DLNNs can successfully replicate a human-like, or super-human, adaptive trader operating in a realistic emulation of a real-world financial market.

This review investigates how HFT could evolve and, by developing a robust understanding of its effects, identifies potential risks and opportunities that HFT could present in terms of financial stability and other market outcomes such as volatility, liquidity, price efficiency, and price discovery. Despite commonly held negative perceptions, the available evidence indicates that HFT and algorithmic trading may have several beneficial effects on markets. However, these types of trading may cause instabilities in financial markets in specific circumstances. Carefully chosen regulatory measures are needed to address concerns in the shorter term. However, further work is needed to inform policies in the longer term, particularly in view of likely uncertainties and lack of data.

We validate our measure using SEC filing-derived data from prior research and identify firm and disclosure characteristics related to it. In our planned hypothesis tests, we find some evidence that the speed of the market response to filings increases with scriptability, but find little evidence that scriptability affects the incidence and speed of news dissemination by Dow Jones. In additional analyses, we find that scriptability exhibits both positive and negative associations with changes in information asymmetry between market participants, depending on the filing, trading window, and measure examined. We also find little evidence that XBRL interacts with scriptability in a meaningful way.

Next, aiming to focus on the most robust companies, the system filters the portfolio by analyzing their economic variables. Finally, the system analyzes prices and volumes to optimize investment decisions during a given period.

Following the ""Flash Crash"" of 2010 which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge 1000 points within minutes, high frequency trading has come under the radar of multi-jurisdictional regulators. Combining a review of the extant literature on high frequency trading with empirical data from interviews with financial traders, computer experts and regulators, we develop concepts of regulatory adaptation, technology asymmetry and market ambiguity to illustrate the 'dark art' of high frequency trading. Findings show high frequency trading is a multi-faceted, complex and secretive practice. It is implicated in market events, but correlation does not imply causation, as isolating causal mechanisms from interconnected automated financial trading is highly challenging for regulators who seek to monitor algorithmic trading across multiple jurisdictions.

QHawkes models generalize the Hawkes price models introduced in Bacry and Muzy [Quant. Finance, 2014, 14(7), 1147–1166], by allowing feedback effects in the jump intensity that are linear and quadratic in past returns. Our model exhibits two main properties that we believe are crucial in the modelling and the understanding of the volatility process: first, the model is time-reversal asymmetric, similar to financial markets whose time evolution has a preferred direction. Second, it generates a multiplicative, fat-tailed volatility process, that we characterize in detail in the case of exponentially decaying kernels, and which is linked to Pearson diffusions in the continuous limit. Several other interesting properties of QHawkes processes are discussed, in particular the fact that they can generate long memory without necessarily being at the critical point. A non-parametric fit of the QHawkes model on NYSE stock data shows that the off-diagonal component of the quadratic kernel indeed has a structure that standard Hawkes models fail to reproduce. We provide numerical simulations of our calibrated QHawkes model which is indeed seen to reproduce, with only a small amount of quadratic non-linearity, the correct magnitude of fat-tails and time reversal asymmetry seen in empirical time series. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Financial prices; Hawkes processes; High-frequency trading; Market microstructure; Pearsons diffusion; Time-reversal asymmetry; Volatility modelling"

Sequential quantile estimation is also known as online quantile estimation. This area is relevant to the analysis of data streams and to the one-pass analysis of massive data sets. Applications include network traffic and latency analysis, real time fraud detection and high frequency trading. We introduce new techniques for online quantile estimation based on Hermite series estimators in the settings of static quantile estimation and dynamic quantile estimation. In the static quantile estimation setting we apply the existing Gauss-Hermite expansion in a novel manner. In particular, we exploit the fact that Gauss-Hermite coefficients can be updated in a sequential manner. To treat dynamic quantile estimation we introduce a novel expansion with an exponentially weighted estimator for the Gauss-Hermite coefficients which we term the Exponentially Weighted Gauss-Hermite (EWGH) expansion. These algorithms go beyond existing sequential quantile estimation algorithms in that they allow arbitrary quantiles (as opposed to pre-specified quantiles) to be estimated at any point in time. In doing so we provide a solution to online distribution function and online quantile function estimation on data streams. In particular we derive an analytical expression for the CDF and prove consistency results for the CDF under certain conditions. In addition we analyse the associated quantile estimator. Simulation studies and tests on real data reveal the Gauss-Hermite based algorithms to be competitive with a leading existing algorithm. © 2017, Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

The establishment of a national market system and Regulation NMS was meant to promote competition, recognizing the evolution and changing dynamics introduced by technological innovation. This evolution and governing rule set has had many positive effects in terms of competition, fee compression, tighter spread potential and volumes. Our paper identifies certain unintended consequences and complexities of the national market system including fragmentation, sub second quoting and trading, complex order types, data asymmetry, technological innovation, unique strategies and the algorithms that power them. When acting in concert, these complexities give rise to opportunities as well as emerging risks. This high-speed system can be unstable and susceptible to inherent conflicts of interest, market abuse and price shocks. These shocks can be amplified by positive feedback loops accelerating single stock declines and also posing systemic risks in time scales beyond real-time physical human comprehension and reaction times. Furthermore they can produce contagion, which we refer to as 'Flash Splashes' caused by rapid withdrawals and injections of liquidity in increasingly linked asset classes, indices, sectors and global liquidity pools. High frequency trading strategies can be both passive and aggressive and usually display risk averse and low inventory characteristics. These strategies leverage fragmentation as they create or capture informational asymmetries. They interact directly with sell side algorithms that can hide intentions, hunt liquidity and sweep the order book. These interactions create market dynamics that can benefit and challenge anyone exposed to US equity markets. Every market participant has a risk profile unique to their strategy and objective and while regulations will be enriched or revised and certain unfair practices eliminated great attention should be paid to understanding modern high speed trading risks and both the positive and negative impacts on all stakeholders. We have examined the regulations, complexities and risks to bring clarity and understanding to the current trading ecosystem for its users.

Modeling the variables' conditional mean processes using a multiplicative error model, we map the resulting residuals into a Gaussian domain using a copula-type transformation. Based on high-frequency volatility, cumulative trading volumes, trade counts and market depth of various stocks traded at the NYSE, we show that the proposed transformation is supported by the data and allows capturing (multivariate) dynamics in higher order moments. The latter are modeled using a DCC-GARCH specification. We suggest estimating the model by composite maximum likelihood which is sufficiently flexible to be applicable in high dimensions. Strong empirical evidence for time-varying conditional (co-)variances in trading processes supports the usefulness of the approach. Taking these higher-order dynamics explicitly into account significantly improves the goodness-of-fit and out-of-sample forecasts of the multiplicative error model. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","DCC-GARCH; Gaussian domain; Liquidity risk; Multiplicative error model; Trading processes"

Whilst many common approaches only consider the bid-ask spread when measuring market impact, the authors aim to analyse the detailed limit order book data, which has more informational content. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from the London Stock Exchange's electronic SETS platform, the authors transform limit order book compositions into volume-weighted average price curves and accordingly estimate market impact. The regression coefficients of these curves are estimated, and their intraday patterns are revealed using a nonparametric kernel regression model. Findings: The authors find that market impact is nonlinear, time-varying, and asymmetric. Inferences drawn from marginal probabilities regarding Granger-causality do not show a significant impact of slope coefficients on the opposite side of the limit order book, thus implying that each side of the market is simultaneously rather than sequentially influenced by prevailing market conditions. Research limitations/implications: Results show that intraday seasonality patterns of liquidity may be exploited through trade scheduling algorithms in an attempt to minimise the trading costs associated with large institutional trades. Originality/value: The use of the detailed limit order book to reveal intraday patterns in liquidity provision offers better insight into the interactions of market participants.

Deriving optimal execution strategies that minimize transaction costs, automated trading engines need to forecast future liquidity levels. By means of an empirical study we provide evidence that the publication of regulatory corporate disclosures is followed by abnormal liquidity levels. As we do not find abnormal liquidity levels prior to the publication, we assume the content to be largely unanticipated. Forecasting models purely based on quantitative input data may therefore not be able to pick up on the liquidity trends in a timely manner. Against this background, we propose two trading signals that allow automated trading engines to appropriately react to news-related liquidity shocks: First, a simple binary ""news"" or ""no news"" signal. Second, a signal that indicates whether or not the publication of a regulatory corporate disclosure will be followed by a negative liquidity shock. Utilizing text mining techniques, the content of the corporate disclosures is analyzed to extract the trading signal. The trading signals are evaluated within a simulation-based use case and turn out to be valuable. We strongly advise developers of automated trading engines to integrate unstructured qualitative data into their models, i.e. the proposed trading signals.","And simulation; Automated trading; E-finance; Forecasting; Liquidity; Text mining"

The limitations of traditional portfolio theory are overcome using a multi-period definition of the problem. The model allows the inclusion of dynamic restrictions like transaction costs, portfolio unbalance, and inflation. A Monte Carlo method is proposed to handle these types of restrictions. The investment strategies method is introduced to make trading decisions based on the investor’s preference and the current state of the market. Preference is determined using heuristics instead of theoretical utility functions. The method was tested using real data from the Mexican market. The method was compared against buy-and-holds and single-period portfolios for metrics like the maximum loss, expected return, risk, the Sharpe’s ratio, and others. The results indicate investment strategies perform trading with less risk than other methods. Single-period methods attained the lowest performance in the experiments due to their high transaction costs. The conclusion was investment decisions that are improved when information providing from many different sources is considered. Also, profitable decisions are the result of a careful balance between action (transaction) and inaction (buy-and-hold). © 2017, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Algorithmic trading; Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective; Portfolio optimization"

Newly, the concept drift is considered as a challenging data imbalance that should be ignored by the NDMs, and only system changes and outliers represent novelty. The field of application for such NDMs is broad. For example, the method can be used as a supportive method for real-time system fault detection, for onset detection of events in biomedical signals, in monitoring of nonlinearly controlled processes, for event driven automated trading, etc. The two newly studied methods are the error and learning based novelty detection (ELBND) and the learning entropy (LE) based detection. These methods use both the error and weight increments of a (supervised) learning model. Here, we study these methods with normalized least-mean squares (NLMS) adaptive filter, and while the NDMs were studied on various real life tasks, newly, we carry out the study on two types of data streams with concept drift to analyze the general ability for unsupervised novelty detection. The two data streams, one with system changes, second with outliers, represent different novelty scenarios to demonstrate the performance of the proposed NDMs with concept drifts in data. Both tested NDMs work as a feature extractor. Thus, a classification framework is used for the evaluation of the obtained features and NDM benchmarking, where two other NDMs, one based on the adaptive model plain error, second using the sample entropy (SE), are used as the reference for the comparison to the proposed methods. The results show that both newly studied NDMs are superior to the merely use of the plain error of adaptive model and also to the sample entropy based detection while they are robust against the concept drift occurrence. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive filter; Concept drift; Learning algorithms; Novelty detection; Outlier detection; Streaming data; System change"

They find that high-frequency trading enhances liquidity by increasing the trade frequency and quantity of low-frequency orders. High-frequency trading also reduces the waiting time of low-frequency limit orders and improves their likelihood of execution.

This method is to calculate the profitability of a trading system, applied to specific past period. The data which are used, correspond to that specific past period and are called “historical data” or “training data”. There is a plethora of trading systems, which include technical indicators, trend following indicators, oscillators, control indicators of price level, etc. It is common nowadays for calculations of technical indicator values to be used along with the prices of securities or shares, as training data in fuzzy, hybrid and support vector machine/regression (SVM/SVR) systems. Whether the data are used in fuzzy systems, or for SVM and SVR systems training, the historical data period selection on most occasions is devoid of validation (In this research we designate historical data as training data). We substantiate that such an expert trading system, has a profitability edge—with regard to future transactions—over currently applied trading strategies that merely implement parameters’ optimization. Thus not profitable trading systems can be turned into profitable. To that end, first and foremost, an optimal historical data period must be determined, secondarily a parameters optimization computation must be completed and finally the right conditions of parameters must be applied for optimal parameters’ selection. In this new approach, we develop an integrated dynamic computation algorithm, called the “d-BackTest PS Method”, for selection of optimal historical data period, periodically. In addition, we test conditions of parameters and values via back-testing, using multi agent technology, integrated in an automated trading expert system based on Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) technical indicator. This dynamic computation algorithm can be used in Technical indicators, Fuzzy, SVR and SVM and hybrid forecasting systems.

In this paper the idea of mixed data sampling (MIDAS) is extended from linear correlation in Colacito et al. (2011) to the more general dependence measure: copula, and a copula-MIDAS model is proposed to describe the asymmetric return-liquidity dependence of CSI 300 index futures with short-run and long-run components. Based on the skewed t copula-MIDAS model, it is found that extreme decreases in returns tend to be accompanied by extreme increases in bid-ask spreads, but extreme increases in returns may not coincide with extreme reductions in bid-ask spreads. Furthermore, the return-spread dependence consists of both short-run and long-run components, and the long-run component will influence the return-spread dependence in the next two weeks. Last, the out-of-sample forecast of liquidity risk stresses the importance of considering asymmetry and long-run trend in return-spread dependence as it enables investors to well predict liquidity risk in times of market crashes. The results imply that high frequency trading investors of CSI 300 index futures should pay more attentions to prevent the potential liquidity risk when the bid-ask spreads are widened. And investors are suggested to use the past two-week high frequency data to forecast the current return-spread dependence in liquidity risk management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Copula; CSI 300 index futures; Liquidity; Mixed data sampling; Return"

This study aims to provide a baseline understanding of the effect of HFT on markets by using a paradigm of zero-intelligence traders and examining the resulting structural changes. Design/methodology/approach-A continuous double auction setting with zero-intelligence traders is used by adapting the model of Gode and Sunder (1993) to include algorithmic high frequency (HF) traders who retrade by marking up their shares by a fixed percentage. The simulation examines the effects of two independent factors, the number of HF traders and their markup percentage, on several dependent variables, principally volume, market efficiency, trader surplus and volatility. Results of the simulations are tested with two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc tests. Findings-In the simulation results, trading volume, efficiency and total surplus vary directly with the number of traders employing HFT. Results also reveal that market volatility increased with the number of HF traders. Research limitations/implications-Increases in volume, efficiency and total surplus represent market improvements due to the trading activities of HF traders. However, the increase in volatility is worrisome, and some of the surplus increase appears to come at the expense of long-term-oriented investors. However, the relatively recent development of HFT and dearth of appropriate data make direct calibration of any model difficult. Originality/value-The simulation study focuses on the structural impact of HF traders on several aspects of the simulated market, with the effects isolated from other noise and problems with empirical data.

In this article, we focus on the portfolio allocation problem using high-frequency financial data, and propose a hybrid parallelization solution to carry out efficient asset allocations in a large portfolio via intra-day highfrequency data.We exploit a variety of HPC techniques, including parallel R, Intelr Math Kernel Library, and automatic offloading to Intelr Xeon Phi coprocessor in particular to speed up the simulation and optimization procedures in our statistical investigations.

First, the parameters of the corresponding Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process are estimated by auto-regressive Hidden Markov Models (AR-HMM) in order to capture the underlying characteristics of the financial time series. Portfolio optimization is then performed according to maximizing the mean return by the means of the introduced ARHMM prediction algorithm. The optimization itself is carried out by stochastic search algorithms. The presented solutions satisfy the cardinality constraint thus providing a sparse portfolios which minimizes the transaction costs and maximizes the interpretability of the results. The performance has been tested on historical data obtained from S&P 500 and FOREX.

The two series are respectively related to the instantaneous volatility and the market liquidity; hence, they are particularly suited to test microstructure hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach: ALog-autoregressive conditional duration model was adopted to include the information on the traders’ identity at the transaction level. High-frequency data were used and how the informed traders and the liquidity provider affect the arrival of market events was studied. The robustness of our results was also checked by testing different distributions and controlling for microstructure effects. Findings: It was found that informed traders and the liquidity provider exert a dominant role in accelerating the market activity. This result depends on the state of the market, i.e. it is effective only during periods of high frequency of transactions. The estimates for price durations show that a high instantaneous volatility can be mainly ascribed to a great concentration of informed traders. Informed traders are also found to shorten volume durations by clustering small-size orders to disguise their private signal. For both durations, the liquidity provider is also found to foster the market activity, likely because of his contractual duties. Originality/value: The article is of interest for researchers in the field of market microstructure, as well as for specialists in the high-frequency trading. Results provide an empirical confirmation of information models which theorize an accelerating effect for informed trading. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first contribution to study the impact of traders’categories at the transaction level and with different definitions of durations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Euronext paris; Financial durations; Informed traders; Liquidity provider; Log-ACD model; Market microstructure"

The main purpose of this study is laid on examining the role of IT based stock trading on financial market efficiency. This research specifically focused on algorithmic trading. Algorithmic trading enables investors to trade stocks through a computer program without the need for human interventions. Based on an empirical analysis of the Korean stock market, this study discovered the positive impact of algorithmic trading on stock market efficiency at three-fold. First, the study results indicate that algorithmic trading contributes to the reduction in asymmetric volatility, which causes inefficiency of information in a stock market. Second, an algorithmic trading also increases the operation efficiency of a stock market. Arbitrage trading contributes on the equilibrium between the spot market and futures market as well as on the price discovery. Third, algorithmic trading provides liquidity for market participants contributing to friction free transactions. The research results indicate that stock exchanges based on electronic communications networks (ECNs) without human intervention could augment a financial market quality by increasing trading share volumes and market efficiency so that it can eventually contribute to the welfare of market investors. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Asymmetric volatility; Efficiency of information; Efficiency of operation; Equilibrium; Liquidity"

Network operators today lack sufficient fine-grain measurement tools to detect, localize, and repair delay spikes that cause application service level agreement (SLA) violations. A recently proposed solution called LDA provides a scalable way to obtain latency, but only provides aggregate measurements. However, debugging application-specific problems requires per-flow measurements since different flows may exhibit significantly different characteristics even when they are traversing the same link. To enable fine-grained per-flow measurements in routers, we propose a new scalable architecture called reference latency interpolation (RLI) that is based on our observation that packets potentially belonging to different flows that are closely spaced to each other exhibit similar delay properties. In our evaluation using simulations over real traces, we show that while having small overhead, RLI achieves a median relative error of 12% and one to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than previous per-flow measurement solutions. We also observe RLI achieves as high accuracy as LDA in aggregate latency estimation, and RLI outperforms LDA in standard deviation estimation. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Latency; Measurements; Per-flow; Router; Switch"

The ever faster development of computers, sensors, and information channels in financial IT has rendered trading data easier to be collected than ever before. The present study examines how the Hilbert transform may be used for the detection of financial market cycles and market trends. In particular, this paper focuses on measuring cyclic patterns of high frequency data to enhance intraday trading. The proposed approach exhibits several advantages over more traditional trading methods, attributed to its consideration of complex variables.","High frequency data; Hilbert transform; Market cycles"

In this chapter we describe a computational framework for statistical arbitrage based on support vector regression. The algorithm learns the fair price of the security under management by minimining a regularized ε-insensitive loss function in an on-line fashion, using the most recent market information acquired by means of streaming financial data. The difficult issue of adaptive learning in non-stationary environments is addressed by adopting an ensemble learning approach, where a meta-algorithm strategically combines the opinion of a pool of experts. Experimental results based on nearly seven years of historical data for the iShare S&P 500 ETF demonstrate that satisfactory risk-adjusted returns can be achieved by the data mining system even after transaction costs. © 2009 Springer US.",

Examples of streaming applications include security agencies processing data from communications media, battlefield management systems for military operations, consumer fraud detection based on on- line transactions, and automated trading based on finan- cial market data. Many stream processing applications are faced with the challenge of increasingly large volumes of data and the requirement to deliver low-latency responses predicated by analysis of that data. In this paper, we assess the applicability of the Blue Gene architecture for stream computing applications. This work is part of a larger effort to demonstrate the efficacy of using a Blue Gene for stream- ing applications. Blue Gene supercomputers provide a high-bandwidth low-latency network connecting a set of I/O and compute nodes. We examine Blue Gene's suitability for stream com- puting applications by assessing its messaging capability for typical stream computing messaging workloads. In par- ticular, this paper presents results from micro-benchmarks we used to evaluate the raw performance of Blue Gene/P (Blue Gene/P) supercomputer under loads produced by high volumes of streaming data. We measure the perfor- mance of data streams that originate outside the supercom- puter, are directed through the I/O nodes to the compute nodes and then terminate outside.

However, the root of this problem is not too much information; rather it is the fact that humans have limited attention spans to handle this information. Humans possess more processing power than computers but computers score over us in having almost unlimited attention spans. We must allocate our attention span in such a way as to maximize the information we obtain, given the constraint of our mental abilities. We have adopted a number of strategies to cope, like using intelligent search agents or spreading what attention we have thinly across as many information sources as possible (in other words skimming). The financial services industry, however, has adopted a radical approach: cut the human out of key parts of information acquisition and processing and use computers instead. This article argues that this approach could well spread to the wider business information market in the next few years. Far from being a threat, this could prove liberating for information professionals, allowing them to become more expert in specific industry sectors. The new breed of industry information portals, or community sites, will greatly aid in this transition and will build professional skills and efficiency.

Without proper validations, evaluations and comparisons, those valuable decision support systems can hardly be adopted trustily. This paper presents a Web-service-agents-based Securities Trading Simulation System (STSS) as a platform to validate, evaluate and compare the existing securities trading decision support systems by using the real world securities trading data from Chicago Stock Exchange. Agent technology is applied to deal with the complex, dynamic, and distributed securities trading processes. Web-services techniques are proposed for more interoperability and scalability in network-based business environment. By integrating agent technology with Web-services to make use of the advantages of both, this approach provides a more intelligent, flexible, and comprehensive platform to simulate the securities trading process.

Using order-level data from the National Stock Exchange of India, we find that proprietary algorithmic traders increase limit order supply following periods of both high short-term stock-specific volatility and extreme stock price movement. Even following periods of high marketwide volatility, they do not decrease their supply of liquidity. We define orders from high-frequency traders as a subclass of orders from proprietary algorithmic traders that are revised in less than three milliseconds. The behavior of high-frequency trading mimics the behavior of its parent class. This is inconsistent with the theory that fast traders leave the market when stress situations arise, although their limit-order-supplying behavior becomes weaker when the increase in short-term volatility is more informational than transitory. Agency algorithmic traders and nonalgorithmic traders behave opposite to proprietary algorithmic traders by reducing the supply of liquidity during stress situations. The presence of faster traders in the market possibly instills the fear of adverse selection in them. We document that the order imbalance of agency algorithmic traders is positively related to future short-term returns, whereas the order imbalance of proprietary algorithmic traders is negatively related to future short-term returns. © 2018 Financial Management Association International",

More investors put their effort to the development of a systematic approach, i.e., the so called ""Trading System (TS)"" for stocks pricing and trend prediction. The introduction of the Trading On-Line (TOL) has significantly improved the overall number of daily transactions on the stock market with the consequent increasing of the market complexity and liquidity. One of the most main consequence of the TOL is the ""automatic trading"", i.e., an ad-hoc algorithmic robot able to automatically analyze a lot of financial data with target to open/close several trading operations in such reduced time for increasing the profitability of the trading system.

The authors propose an innovative approach based on usage of ad-hoc machine learning approach, starting from historical data analysis, is able to perform careful stock price prediction. The stock price prediction accuracy is further improved by using adaptive correction based on the hypothesis that stock price formation is regulated by Markov stochastic propriety.

To achieve runtime on-the-spot branch divergence reduction, we propose the frst on-GPU thread-data remapping scheme. Before kernel launching, our solution inserts codes into GPU kernels immediately before each target branch so as to acquire actual runtime divergence information. GPU software threads can be remapped to datasets multiple times during single kernel execution. We propose two thread-data remapping algorithms that are tailored to the GPU architecture. Effective on two generations of GPUs from both NVIDIA and AMD, our solution achieves speedups up to 2.718 with third-party benchmarks. We also implement three GPGPU frontier benchmarks from areas including computer vision, algorithmic trading and data analytics. They are hindered by more complex divergence coupled with different memory access patterns, and our solution works better than the traditional thread-data remapping scheme in all cases. As a compiler-assisted runtime solution, it can better reduce divergence for divergent applications that gain little acceleration on GPUs for the time being. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Branch divergence; GPGPU; Parallel computing; SIMD"

Based on our empirical findings, we develop a queuing model that captures stylized facts on the data.

We apply the queuing model in an algorithmic trading setting by considering an agent maximizing her expected utility through placing and cancelling of LOs.

A simulation study shows that for the same level of standard deviation of terminal wealth, the optimal strategy has a 2.5% higher mean compared to a strategy which ignores the effect of position, or an 8.8% lower standard deviation for the same level of mean.

Not only trading highly affected by the accuracy of the price of Asian options but also portfolios that involve hedging of commodity. Several attempts have been made to model the Asian option prices with closed-form over the past twenty years such as the Kemna-Vorst Model and Levy Approximation. Although today the two closed-form models are still widely used, their accuracy and reliability are called into question. The reason is simple; the Kemna-Vorst model is derived with an assumption of geometric mean of the stocks. In practice, Average Priced Options are mostly arithmetic and thus always have a volatility high than the volatility of a geometric mean making the Asian options always underpriced. On the other hand, the Levy Approximation using Monte Carlo Simulation as a benchmark, do not perform well when the product of the sigma (volatility) and square root maturity of the underlying is larger than 0.2. When the maturity of the option enlarges, the performance of the Levy Approximation largely deteriorates. If the closed-form models could be improved, higher frequency trading of Asian option will become possible. Moreover, building neural networks for different contracts of Asian Options allows reuse of computed prices and large-scale portfolio management that involves many contracts. In this thesis, we use Neural Network to fill the gap between the price of a closed-form model and that of an Asian option. The significance of this method answers two interesting questions. First, could an Asian option trader with a systematic behavior in pricing learned from previous quotes improve his pricing or trading performance in the future? Second, will a training set of previous data help to improve the performance of a financial model? We perform two simulation experiments and show that the performance of the closed-form model is significantly improved. Moreover, we extend the learning process to real data quote. The use of Neural Network highly improves the accuracy of the traditional closed-form model.

Price impact of block trades is stronger during the first hour of trading; this is consistent with the hypothesis that information accumulates overnight during non-trading hours. Furthermore, private information is gradually incorporated into prices despite heightened trading frequency. Evidence suggests that informed traders exploit superior information across trading days, and stocks with lower transparency exhibit stronger information diffusion effects when traded in blocks, thus informed block trading facilitates price discovery. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Block trades; Informed trading; Opacity; Price discovery; Price impact; Transparency"

The problem, however, is that most of these methods is based on daily trading data. When facing the high frequency trading data which is more powerful in short-term forecasting, these methods become incapable. Inspired by the development of Convolutional Neural Network in image recognition tasks, this paper tries to apply the Convolutional Neural Network on the high frequency financial trading data, and has achieved good results. We collect the close price of Shanghai Composite Index from 2006 to 2008 and from 2014 to 2015, about 1000 trading days in total. The frequency of the trading data is 5 min. The paper intends to forecast the stock’s future trend of the next day from historical data, namely, go up or down. First, we apply Hodrick-Prescott decomposition [1] on the original time series. The Hodrick-Prescott filter(decomposition) is a mathematical tool used in macroeconomics to separate the cyclical component ct and trend component τt from a time series. After preprocessing, the proposed method novelly transforms the time series into pictures. We apply GASF, GADF and MTF algorithm [2] on the time series respectively, forming the R, G and B channels of a picture. By transforming each of the time series into picture mode, the trading time series produces a picture library. Finally, the proposed method uses AlexNet architecture as feature extractor and classifier. The net has five convolution layers, three pooling layers, and two fully-connected layers. In data set of time series from 2006 to 2008, we choose the training data and the testing data randomly, and the proposed method can keep the accuracy at about 0.55 on the binary classification problem. In data set of time series from 2014 to 2015, we choose the last 16 training days of the data set as testing data and the accuracy can reach up to 0.60. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Convolutional neural network; Stock forecasting"

To develop efficient and effective automated trading strategies, we need to understand the workings of the market and the patterns emerging as a result of the traders interactions. In this paper, we develop an adaptive Genetic Programming (GP) agent-based trading system under Intraday Seasonality Model (ISM), which is abbreviated as GP-ISM trading system. ISM is used for creating maps and visualizing the dynamic price evolution of the asset during the day. This new model permits the recognition of periodic patterns and seasonalities in the price time series and hence eliminates any unnecessary data input. We use a high-frequency dataset of historical price data from Saudi Stock Market, which enables us to run multiple market simulation runs and draw comparisons and conclusions for the developed trading strategies. The goal of our work is to develop automated computational intelligence-based strategies for real markets, and this study facilitates a more thorough understanding of a specific market's workings and constitutes the basis for further exploration into such strategies designed for the stock market. We evaluate the intelligence of the GP-ISM trading system through agent-based simulation market index trading. For comparison, we also include four other types of trading agents in this contest, namely, zero-intelligence agents, Buy-and-Hold agents, fundamental agents and technical analysis agents. As a result, GP-ISM performs the best, which provides a general framework for the further development of automated trading strategies and decision support systems. © 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

It first relates the history of mathematics to the history of financial technologies, and argues, inspired by Simmel and Marcuse, that from ancient times to now there seems to be an evolution towards increasing quantification not only in finance, accounting etc., but in modern society in general. It shows that scientific and technological changes have social and ethical consequences, as quantification creates more distance between people. The paper then analyzes and discusses current shifts of financial agency that exemplify what seems to be a moment of hyper-quantification through the use of ICTs: experiences of “the market” as an independent agent and money machines as artificial agents in high frequency trading—perhaps the only agents still able to cope with the data-loaded and hyper-quantified world we live in. Under these conditions it becomes more difficult to exercise responsibility. The paper concludes that while we must acknowledge the human character of finance and mathematics, there are real human and social consequences of quantification, in ancient times and today, for society and responsibility. It is therefore misleading to assume that financial technologies and mathematics are ethically neutral; more analysis of ethical and societal aspects is needed, also from an “outside” perspective. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Artificial agents; Distance; Ethics of finance; Marcuse; Mathematics; Phenomenology; Philosophy of finance; Philosophy of technology and media; Quantification; Responsibility; Simmel; Sociology of finance"

The academic roots of this industry-changing deployment of AI technologies can be traced back to research published by a team of researchers at IBM at IJCAI 2001, which was subsequently replicated and extended by De Luca and Cliff at IJCAI 2011 and ICAART 2011. Here, we focus on the order management policy enforced by Open Exchange (OpEx), the open source algorithmic trading system designed by De Luca, for both human and robot traders: while humans are allowed to manage multiple orders simultaneously, robots only deal with one order at the time. We hypothesise that such unbalance may have strongly influenced the victory of human traders over robot traders, reported in past studies by De Luca et al., and by Cartlidge and Cliff. We employed OpEx to implement a multiple-order policy for robots as well as humans, and ran several human vs. robot trading experiments. Using aggregated market metrics and time analysis, we reached two important conclusions. First, we demonstrated that, in mixed human-robot markets, robots dealing multiple simultaneous orders consistently outperform robots dealing one order at a time. And second, we showed that while human traders outperform single-order robot traders under specific circumstances, multiple-order robot traders are never outperformed by human traders. We thus conclude that the performance of robot traders in a human-robot mixed market is strongly influenced by the order management policy they employ.

One of the most influential and revolutionary processes in financial markets is algorithmic trading. The focus of this work is to increase trading efficiency by improving the accuracy of intraday volume forecasts, which are used in algorithmic trading. An intraday volume forecast predicts the distribution of trading volume throughout the day, and allows traders to make better decisions regarding the timing and quantity of their trades. An accurate intraday volume forecast is an important input to trading decisions and will ultimately improve traders' ability to meet benchmarks, such as volume weighted average price. This work seeks to understand the performance of three classes of models: moving average, exponentially weighted moving average, and average exponentially weighted moving average, for intra-day volume prediction over a large sample of U.S. equities. For each model, we explore a broad range of parameterizations and seek to understand how various factors affect model performance. Models are evaluated based on a variety of different metrics, such as mean square error and maximum absolute deviation. We report on the best performing models for a variety of stocks and scenarios. Overall, the average exponentially weighted moving average model performed the best across the examined parameters. © 2015 IEEE.","Algorithmic Trading; Exponentially Weighted Moving Average; Moving Average; Volume Profile"

When an analysis of RRL trading performance is conducted using low frequency financial data (e.g. daily data), the weakening autocorrelation in price changes may lead to a decrease in trading profits as compared to its applications in high frequency trading. There therefore is a need to improve RRL for the purposes of daily equity trading. This paper presents two parameter update schemes (the 'average elitist' and the 'multiple elitist') for RRL. The purpose of the first scheme is to improve out-of-sample performance of RRL-type trading systems. The second scheme aims to exploit serial dependence in stock returns to improve trading performance, when traders deal with highly correlated stocks. Profitability and stability of the trading system are examined by using four groups of S&P stocks for the period January 2009 to December 2012. It is found that the Sharpe ratios of the stocks increase after we use the two parameter update schemes in the RRL trading system. © 2014 IEEE.",

However, the MM strategies without any forecasting power are not safe while trading. In this paper, we design and implement a twotier framework, which includes a trading signal generator based on a supervised learning approach and an event-driven MM strategy. The proposed generator incorporates the information within order book microstructure and market news to provide directional predictions. The MM strategy in the second tier trades on the signals and prevents itself from profit loss led by market trending. Using half a year price tick data from Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), and corresponding Thomson Reuters news of the same time period, we conduct the back-testing and simulation on an industrial near-to-reality simulator. From the empirical results, we find that 1) strategies with signals perform better than strategies without any signal in terms of average daily profit and loss (PnL) and sharpe ratio (SR), and 2) correct predictions do help MM strategies readjust their quoting along with market trending, which avoids the strategies triggering stop loss procedure that further realizes the paper loss. © 2014 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","algorithmic trading; market making strategy; market simulation; news impact analysis; order book microstructure"

Financial economists approach finance theory by focusing on whether to reject a pricing model based on hypothesis tests. However, this approach often fails to capture aspects of the model and latent information in the data that could be potentially useful to the investor. Owing to these limitations, investors have increasingly turned to high-frequency trading as a means of achieving risk-mitigated wealth appreciation. High frequency trading is a strategy that relies on professional proprietary formula-driven trading algorithms to execute millisecond trades using high-speed computers that are placed near or in the proximity of the exchanges to reduce order latency time. The contemporary impact of this new approach has increased the speed and complexity of trading, and has had an impact on market liquidity and transparency. In turn, this has attracted the attention of regulators who are ""Clamping Down on Rapid Trades in the Stock Market"" [3] and the risk of such trades to create volatility by flooding the market with orders before canceling these same orders in fractions of seconds. Facing the possibility of regulatory oversight, many highfrequency automated traders are now turning to the alternative of near high-frequency trading. Instead of focusing on strategies to implement strategic runs in the millisecondenvironment, using the highest resolution data available, near high-frequency trading solves complex econometric models on an instrument by instrument basis to predict the profitability of a future trade. In this paper we present a theory of stochastic price formation to form a behavioral near high frequency automated trading system. The new system is actuated by a combining dual radial basis function artificial neural networks and two fundamental trading metrics. Additionally, because the trading signals are generated by cognitive models, the research calibrates a nonparametric behavioral production function to estimate the quasi elasticity coefficients of a four factor model. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It is very common in practice that the same problems emerge in different application domains (e.g. the modeling support for complex event processing is desirable in the domain of algorithmic trading, IT security assessment, robust monitoring, etc.). A DSL operates in one single domain, but the above-mentioned cross-domain challenges raise the question: is it possible to automate the design of DSLs which are so closely related? This approach demonstrates how a family of domain-specific languages can be developed for multiple domains from a single generic language metamodel with generative techniques. The basic idea is to refine the targeted domain with separating the problem domain from the context domain. This allows designing a generic language based on the problem and customizing it with the appropriate extensions for arbitrary contexts, thus defining as many DSLs and as many contexts as one extends the generic language for. The authors also present an ontology-based approach for establishing contextspecific domain knowledge bases. The results are discussed through a case study, where a language for event processing is designed and extended for multiple context domains. © 2014 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.",

Solutions employing long-running continuous queries executed in-memory show their limits in applications characterized by a staggering growth of available sources that continuously produce new events at high rates (e.g. intrusion detection systems and algorithmic trading). Problems arise due to the complexities in maintaining large amounts of events in memory for continuous elaboration, and due to the difficulties in managing at run-time the network of elaborating nodes. A batch approach to this kind of computation provides a viable solution for scenarios characterized by non frequent computations of very large time windows. In this paper we propose a model for batch processing in time window event computations that allows the definition of multiple metrics for performance optimization. These metrics specifically take into account the organization of input data to minimize its impact on computation latency. The model is then instantiated on Hadoop, a batch processing engine based on the MapReduce paradigm, and a set of strategies for efficiently arranging input data is described and evaluated.

Applications include social content recommendation, algorithmic trading, and other scenarios where a configuration of local prediction models of high-frequency streams is used to provide a realtime service. For stationary data, the proposed protocol retains the asymptotic optimal regret of previous algorithms. At the same time, it allows to substantially reduce network communication, and, in contrast to previous approaches, it remains applicable when the data is non-stationary and shows rapid concept drift. The protocol is based on controlling the divergence of the local models in a decentralized way. Its beneficial properties are also confirmed empirically.",

The theoretical part introduces a set of equations and presents an Agent Based Model implemented via a computer-based simulation. The wide spread leads to the appearance of unusual phenomena caused by the relative speed difference between the fast and slow traders. The latter agents tend to quote limit orders that look irrational, as they are distant more than one tick from the top-of-book. The same relative speed difference causes slow traders to post market orders that execute at price worse than originally intended. Both these abnormal orders tend to increase local volatility. Other results found by the simulation are an increase in global volatility (computed both as the difference of maximum less minimum price and as standard deviation of price distribution) and in volatility at sub-second timescales. These occurrences penalise slower traders and affect market stability. All the results are consistent both under quiet and stressed market conditions.

To tackle this problem, two completely opposite approaches, namely technical and fundamental analysis, emerged. Technical analysis bases its predictions on mathematical indicators constructed on the stocks price, while fundamental analysis exploits the information retrieved from news, profitability, and macroeconomic factors. The competition between these schools of thought has led to many interesting achievements, however, to date, no satisfactory solution has been found. Our work aims to combine both technical and fundamental analysis through the application of data science and machine learning techniques. In this paper, the stock market prediction problem is mapped in a classification task of time series data. Indicators of technical analysis and the sentiment of news articles are both exploited as input. The outcome is a robust predictive model able to forecast the trend of a portfolio composed by the twenty most capitalized companies listed in the NASDAQ100 index.

Wang and Zheng (2014) proposed in their book that the technical indicators can be transformed into the stationary process and investigated the profitability and availability. But in fact, we can only test that a data series form a weakly stationary process but a strongly stationary process. Nevertheless, the convergence of a more stationary process will vanish faster, thus it is much better if we can get a more stationary process. In this paper, we propose a method to get a more strongly (or weakly) process named mean reverting process that based on the original strongly (or weakly) stationary process.

These architectures are capable of modeling and predicting vector autoregressive VAR(p) time series. In order to avoid overfitting, the input is pre-processed by independent component analysis to filter out the most noise like component. In this way, the accuracy of the prediction and the trading performance is increased. The proposed algorithms have a small number of free parameters which makes fast learning and trading possible. The method is not only tested on single asset price series, but also on predicting the value of mean reverting portfolios obtained by maximizing the predictability parameter of VAR(1) processes. The tests were first performed on artificially generated data and then on real data selected from exchange traded fund time series including bid–ask spread.

Afterwards, this study explores the use of optimal causal paths as a means for identifying promising stock pairs and for generating buy and sell signals. For this purpose, the established trading strategy exploits information about the leading stock to predict future returns of the following stock. The value-add of the proposed framework is assessed by benchmarking it with variants relying on classic similarity measures and a buy-and-hold investment in the S&P 500 index.

Basically, a grid trading strategy is a method that seeks to make profit on the market movements of the underlying financial instrument by positioning buy and sell orders properly time-spaced (grid distance). The main advantage of the grid trading strategy is the financial sustainability of the algorithm because it provides a robust way to mediate losses in financial transactions even though this also means very complicated trades management algorithm. For these reasons, grid trading is certainly one of the best approaches to be used in high frequency trading (HFT) strategies. Due to the high level of unpredictability of the financial markets, many investment funds and institutional traders are opting for the HFT (high frequency trading) systems, which allow them to obtain high performance due to the large number of financial transactions executed in the short-term timeframe. The combination of HFT strategies with the use of machine learning methods for the financial time series forecast, has significantly improved the capability and overall performance of the modern automated trading systems. Taking this into account, the authors propose an automatic HFT grid trading system that operates in the FOREX (foreign exchange) market. The performance of the proposed algorithm together with the reduced drawdown confirmed the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. © 2019 by the authors.","Data forecasting; Financial time-series; Machine learning"

In this paper, we apply higher-order Factorization Machines, for which efficient training algorithms have only been available since 2016.

In 2019, most securities trading is conducted electronically on digital markets. One type of trading strategy, high-frequency trading, utilizes algorithms, data centers, fiber optic cables, and supercomputers to obtain an edge in the market. High-frequency trading has leveraged advancements in technology to constitute over half of all trading volume in a given day. High-frequency trading, however, has come under scrutiny in recent years as it has increased market susceptibility to certain forms of criminal conduct. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the first conviction of a high-frequency trader for spoofing, a type of trader misconduct that is made more susceptible by high-frequency trading. While scholars have debated whether high-frequency trading should be regulated more than other types of trading and if so, what the regulations might look like, no one has analyzed criminal law as a vehicle to regulate high-frequency trading. This Comment makes the case that individual criminal liability is an ideal tool to regulate misconduct in the high-frequency trading space. Two features of high-frequency trading make the strategy particularly challenging to regulate: 1) it is difficult to draw a line between legitimate and illegitimate behavior in high-frequency trading; and 2) it is difficult to pinpoint an exact definition of what high-frequency trading is. Criminal liability has several advantages over civil liability with respect to these challenges. First, the mens rea component and higher standard of proof required in criminal liability will ensure that high-frequency traders found criminally liable engaged in illegitimate behavior with a higher degree of certainty. Second, the threat of criminal prosecution will better serve the goal of deterring high-frequency trader misconduct. Within the context of criminal liability, individual criminal liability is preferable to corporate criminal liability because the former better furthers the goal of deterrence. The identity problem that corporate liability helps to solve—in some corporate contexts it is impossible to pinpoint culpability on any single individual—is not an issue in high-frequency trading; and individual criminal liability is socially more preferable as a matter of policy. Accordingly, the government should increase criminal enforcement of high-frequency traders to promote its goal of safeguarding market integrity. © 2019 by Orlando Cosme Jr.",

First, we propose a trading system that can predict the number of shares to trade. Specifically, we design an automated system that predicts the number of shares by adding a deep neural network (DNN) regressor to a deep Q-network, thereby combining reinforcement learning and a DNN. Second, we study various action strategies that use Q-values to analyze which action strategies are beneficial for profits in a confused market. Finally, we propose transfer learning approaches to prevent overfitting from insufficient financial data. We use four different stock indices—the S&P500, KOSPI, HSI, and EuroStoxx50—to experimentally verify our proposed methods and then conduct extensive research. The proposed automated trading system, which enables us to predict the number of shares with the DNN regressor, increases total profits by four times in S&P500, five times in KOSPI, 12 times in HSI, and six times in EuroStoxx50 compared with the fixed-number trading system. When the market situation is confused, delaying the decision to buy or sell increases total profits by 18% in S&P500, 24% in KOSPI, and 49% in EuroStoxx50. Further, transfer learning increases total profits by twofold in S&P500, 3 times in KOSPI, twofold in HSI, and 2.5 times in EuroStoxx50.

It focuses on the UK regime. The insights derived are envisaged to be helpful guides for participants and regulators in financial markets. Design/methodology/approach: This paper used the legal-economics perspective. It relied on primary data from statutes and regulations and secondary data from the public domain to analyze the phenomenon. The analytical framework comprised the following sections: Introduction, MiFID I review, MiFID II scope, MiFID II key concerns and concluding remarks. Findings: Only half of the EU Member States including the UK managed to transpose MiFID II within the 3rd January 2018 effective date. At this early stage of implementation, various teething problems were encountered. These pertained to costs and charges reporting, firm governance, product governance, transaction reporting, best execution and research. Owing to the sheer scale and complexity of MIFID II, most entities barely coped with their reporting obligations. Noting the situation, the Financial Conduct Authority assured firms taking all sufficient steps that they would be treated fairly. Research limitations/implications: The paper was not sufficiently empirical. However, the study benefited reasonably from triangulation of data and perspectives to provide good insights on the implementation effects of the complex and voluminous EU rules for governing financial markets with global implications.

The price of these currencies changes rapidly. However, we need to have a good trading strategy to take advantage of these variations. As Forex is a dynamic market, it becomes more difficult to control trading behavior and it becomes very complex to predict the events that can occur. Due to the chaotic, noisy, and nonstationary nature of the data, many algorithmic approaches were adopted in the aim to help traders and make FOREX speculation successful. Algorithmic trading offers the ability to have a strategy in advance. It helps traders to take the final decision. When the decision is so wide and complex, that one algorithm cannot possess all rules to take it. It becomes necessary to call upon several agents, who must work together in pursuing a common objective. These agents co-operate with one another to solve these decision problems. Coordinating between agents in a multi-agent system gives more flexibility and performance to problem solving. Each agent simultaneous results are combined by using a super-agent who helps to make the final decision. In our paper, we propose a theoretical Multi Agent System for stock market Speculation. We use four agents working in one system. The first one is a Metaheuristic Algorithm agent, the second one is based on technical indicators, the third one is a Text Mining agent, and the fourth one is a Fundamental Factor agent. The final decision should be made based on the combination of the four agents results. We think that working with Metaheuristics can improve speculation results compared to the use of classical algorithms. In perspective work, we test our system on a multiagent systems platform. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Fundamental factor; Metaheuristic; Multi agent system; Particle swarm optimization; Smart agent; Speculation; Stock market; Technical indicators; Text mining"

Previous work in this field investigates how the true sentiment of text (i.e., positive or negative opinions) can be used for financial predictions, based on the assumption that sentiments expressed online are representative of the true market sentiment. Here we consider the converse idea, that using the stock price as the ground-truth in the system may be a better indication of sentiment. Tweets are labelled as Buy or Sell dependent on whether the stock price discussed rose or fell over the following hour, and from this, stock-specific dictionaries are built for individual companies. A Bayesian classifier is used to generate stock predictions, which are input to an automated trading algorithm. Placing 468 trades over a 1 month period yields a return rate of 5.18%, which annualises to approximately 83% per annum. This approach performs significantly better than random chance and outperforms two baseline sentiment analysis methods tested. © 2018 IEEE.","Automated Trading; Financial Engineering; Financial Markets; Machine Learning; Sentiment Analysis"

It ensures that all investors are able to buy and sell assets quickly at a fair price. High Frequency Traders (HFTs) utilize sophisticated algorithms operating with extreme speed and are frequently cited as liquidity providers. The objective of this paper is to investigate the liquidity provision of a number of HFTs to determine their effects on aggregate marketplace liquidity. We consider a large data set collected from the Australian Securities Exchange throughout 2013, providing a near complete picture of all trading activity. Our method is to consider temporal bar charts, association scatterplots, faceted plots and network diagrams to provide visualizations that yield both novel and conventional insights into how HFTs are operating in the market, specifically with respect to liquidity provision. Consistent with HFTs avoiding adverse selection, our results show that on aggregate, HFTs often consume rather than provide liquidity. Furthermore, liquidity consumption often occurs very quickly over intra-millisecond time periods. We conclude that HFTs are not exclusively focused on liquidity provision. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Data visualization; High frequency trading; Large data; Tick data"

We develop an artificial futures market populated with high-frequency traders (HFTs) and institutional traders using Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP) trading algorithm. We simulate real-life futures trading at the millisecond time frame by applying STGP to E-Mini S&P 500 data stamped at the millisecond interval. A direct forecasting comparison between HFTs and institutional traders indicate the superiority of the former. We observe that the negative implications of high-frequency trading in futures markets can be mitigated by introducing a minimum resting trading period of less than 50 milliseconds. Overall, we contribute to the e-commerce literature by showing that minimum resting trading order period of less than 50 milliseconds could lead to HFTs facing a queuing risk resulting in a less harmful market quality effect. One practical implication of our study is that we demonstrate that market regulators and/or e-commerce practitioners can apply artificial intelligence tools such as STGP to conduct trading behavior-based profiling.

So far, there have been very limited attempts for extracting relevant features based on the limit order book data. In this paper, we address this problem by designing a new set of handcrafted features and performing an extensive experimental evaluation on both liquid and illiquid stocks. More specifically, we present an extensive set of econometric features that capture the statistical properties of the underlying securities for the task of mid-price prediction. The experimental evaluation consists of a head-to-head comparison with other handcrafted features from the literature and with features extracted from a long short-term memory autoencoder by means of a fully automated process. Moreover, we develop a new experimental protocol for online learning that treats the task above as a multi-objective optimization problem and predicts: 1) the direction of the next price movement and; 2) the number of order book events that occur until the change takes place. In order to predict the mid-price movement, features are fed into nine different deep learning models based on multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and long short-term memory neural networks. The performance of the proposed method is then evaluated on liquid and illiquid stocks (i.e., TotalView-ITCH US and Nordic stocks). For some stocks, results suggest that the correct choice of a feature set and a model can lead to the successful prediction of how long it takes to have a stock price movement. © 2019 IEEE.","Deep learning; econometrics; high-frequency trading; limit order book; mid-price; U.S. data"

It turns out, however, that real data do not always support the genuine Poisson process. This has lead to variants and augmentations such as time dependent and varying intensities, for example. This paper investigates the fractional Poisson process. We introduce the process and elaborate its main characteristics. The exemplary application considered here is the Carmér–Lundberg theory and the Sparre Andersen model. The fractional regime leads to initial economic stress. On the other hand we demonstrate that the average capital required to recover a company after ruin does not change when switching to the fractional Poisson regime.

The agents negotiate with one another to reach the best agreement for the users they represent. An obstacle in the future of automated negotiators is that the agent may not always have a priori information about the preferences of the user it represents. The purpose of this work is to develop an agent that will be able to negotiate given partial information about the user’s preferences. First, we present a new partial information model that is supplied to the agent, which is based on categorical data in the form of pairwise comparisons of outcomes instead of precise utility information. Using this partial information, we develop an estimation model that uses linear optimization and translates the information into utility estimates. We test our methods in a negotiation scenario based on a smart grid cooperative where agents participate in energy trade-offs. The results show that already with very limited information the model becomes accurate quickly and performs well in an actual negotiation setting. Our work provides valuable insight into how uncertainty affects an agent’s negotiation performance, how much information is needed to be able to formulate an accurate user model, and shows a capability of negotiating effectively with minimal user feedback. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",

This is a major issue, as trading speed overwhelming the capability of the server to cope with the incoming orders might jeopardise the orderly functioning of the markets. It will be shown how, by raising the speed of trading and increasing the number of the agents operating in the market, it is possible to generate a crisis, no matter how performing the exchange server is. The paper presents a theoretical framework and then verifies its occurrence by analysing audit trail data. The theoretical framework shows a scenario in which under certain, heavy but by no means uncommon, conditions, the excess speed of the trading agents with respect to servers is capable of exacerbating price volatility, leading to vicious feedback loops capable of potentially creating a financial crisis. The empirical part analyses data taken from a particularly volatile day and compares them with much less volatile days. It results that, because of excessive speed, one of the most widely used techniques for minimising risk, order churning, can cause a major crisis. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

In addition, multiple optimization techniques are used to optimize the return and control risk in trading.

In this paper, deep learning LSTM techniques have been used to solve volatility forecasting problem of INR USD currency pair. The research uses an innovative approach in arrangement of data to make use of recent 25 values for forecasting volatility trend. The algorithm forecasts uptrend or downtrend movement of volatility a day ahead. The experiments were conducted to forecast volatility using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The LSTM technique is experimented with several epochs and configurations to yield better accuracy. The results show that LSTM techniques produced better accuracy compared with neural networks, SVM, random forest, regression, decision trees and boosting techniques. One of the main application of this research paper is forecasting the rise and fall of INR versus USD. The approach can also be applied to forecasting problems in algorithmic trading, churn predictions, Lead optimization and Fraud detections. © 2018 IEEE.","Deep learning; Forecasting; LSTM; Volatility"

High levels of order flow toxicity can culminate in market makers providing liquidity at a loss or in the suboptimal execution of trades. From a regulatory perspective, high levels of toxicity can be harmful to overall market liquidity and precede precipitous drops in asset prices. The bulk volume-volume-synchronized probability of informed trading (BV-VPIN) model is one way of measuring the “toxicity” component of order flow, and it has been successfully applied in high-frequency trading environments. We apply the BV-VPIN to daily data from a range of international indexes in order to extend previous analyses of its properties.We find that a rise in BV-VPIN effectively foreshadows high levels of volatility in the equity indexes of several countries. If a BV-VPIN futures contract were to exist, we show that it would exhibit safe haven characteristics during market downturns. In particular, a simple active portfolio management strategy that times investments in equities (risk-free assets) when BV-VPIN levels are low (high) outperforms a buy-and-hold strategy. Thus, we find support for the application of BV-VPIN in international equity markets as a risk monitoring and management tool for portfolio managers and regulators. © 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","Bulk volume classification; International equities; Liquidity; Order flow toxicity; VPIN"

The in-depth analysis of features available in commercial software demonstrates that there is no commercial software that natively supports machine learned strategy development. Furthermore, previously published academic software products are not publicly obtainable. Hence, this work concentrates on developing a full-stack solution from data capture, back-testing to automated Strategy Agent development for betting exchanges.

In this paper, we primarily focus on accelerating stream joins, arguably one of the most commonly used and resource-intensive operators in stream processing. We propose a scalable circular pipeline design (Circular-MJ) in hardware to orchestrate multi-way join while minimizing data flow disruption. In this circular design, each new tuple (given its origin stream) starts its processing from a specific join core and passes through all respective join cores in a pipeline sequence to produce final results. We further present a novel two-stage pipeline stream join (Stashed-MJ) that uses a best-effort buffering technique (stash) to maintain intermediate results. In a case that an overwrite is detected in the stash, our design automatically resorts to recomputing intermediate results. Our experimental results demonstrate a linear throughput scaling with respect to the number of execution units in hardware. © 2018 IEEE.","FPGA; Hardware acceleration; Heterogeneous hardware; Parallel algorithms; Query optimization; Stream Joins"

Our paper uses recent high-frequency data (HFD) and investigates price comovements in the context of normal times and crisis periods. To this end, we applied a non-Gaussian Asymmetrical Dynamic Conditional Correlation (ADCC)-GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) model and the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) approach. This choice has three advantages: (i) With the development of high-frequency trading (HFT), it is more appropriate to use HFD to test price linkages for overlapping and nonoverlapping data. (ii) The ADCC-GARCH model captures further asymmetry in price comovements. (iii) The use of the MES enables to measure systemic risk contributions around the distribution tails. Accordingly, we offer two interesting findings. First, while the hypothesis of asymmetrical and time-varying stock return linkages is not rejected, the MES approach indicates that both European and US indices make a considerable contribution to each other's systemic risk, with significant input from Frankfurt to the French and US markets, especially following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Second, we show that the propagation of systemic risk is higher during the crisis period and overlapping trading hours than during nonoverlapping hours. Thus, the MES test is recommended as an indicator to help monitor market exposure to systemic risk and to gauge expected losses for other markets.

Calendar spread option volume has been low and a more precise model to price them could lead to lower bid-ask spreads as well as more accurate marking to market of open positions. Design/methodology/approach: The new option pricing model is a two-factor model with the futures price and the convenience yield as the two factors. The key assumption is that convenience follows arithmetic Brownian motion. The new model and alternative models are tested using corn futures prices. The testing considers both the accuracy of distributional assumptions and the accuracy of the models’ predictions of historical payoffs. Findings: Panel unit root tests fail to reject the unit root null hypothesis for historical calendar spreads and thus they support the assumption of convenience yield following arithmetic Brownian motion. Option payoffs are estimated with five different models and the relative performance of the models is determined using bias and root mean squared error. The new model outperforms the four other models; most of the other models overestimate actual payoffs. Research limitations/implications: The model is parameterized using historical data due to data limitations although future research could consider implied parameters. The model assumes that storage costs are constant and so it cannot separate between negative convenience yield and mismeasured storage costs. Practical implications: The over 30-year search for a calendar spread pricing model has not produced a satisfactory model. Current models that do not assume cointegration will overprice calendar spread options. The model used by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for marking to market of open positions is shown to work poorly. The model proposed here could be used as a basis for automated trading on calendar spread options as well as marking to market of open positions. Originality/value: The model is new. The empirical work supports both the model’s assumptions and its predictions as being more accurate than competing models. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Calendar spreads; Corn; Futures; Options; Panel unit root tests"

We develop an empirical measure of price discovery which is suited to asynchronous, high-frequency financial data and test the model predictions.

These strategies result in substantial trading profits between November 2007 and June 2015. Controlling for CMBS sector risk factors, we reject CMBS market efficiency over the entire sample period. When we split the sample into the Crisis and Recovery periods, we observe persistent abnormal returns over both subperiods, which is consistent with an inefficient CMBS market.

In times of financial crisis, large market orders are more likely which leads to a significant increase of Ultrafast Extreme Events occurrences.

Using a quantitative viewpoint, this book explains how an attrition of liquidity and regulatory changes can impact the whole microstructure of financial markets. A mathematical Appendix details the quantitative tools and indicators used through the book, allowing the reader to go further independently. This book is written by practitioners and theoretical experts and covers practical aspects (like the optimal infrastructure needed to trade electronically in modern markets) and abstract analyses (like the use on entropy measurements to understand the progress of market fragmentation). As market microstructure is a recent academic field, students will benefit from the book's overview of the current state of microstructure and will use the Appendix to understand important methodologies. Policy makers and regulators will use this book to access theoretical analyses on real cases. For readers who are practitioners, this book delivers data analysis and basic processes like the designs of Smart Order Routing and trade scheduling algorithms. In this second edition, the authors have added a large section on orderbook dynamics, showing how liquidity can predict future price moves, and how High Frequency Traders can profit from it. The section on market impact has also been updated to show how buying or selling pressure moves prices not only for a few hours, but even for days, and how prices relax (or not) after a period of intense pressure. Further, this edition includes pages on Dark Pools, Circuit Breakers and added information outside of Equity Trading, because MiFID 2 is likely to push fixed income markets towards more electronification. The authors explore what is to be expected from this change in microstructure.

In this article, we develop an agent-based model of the foreign exchange (FX) market, which is the market for the buying and selling of currencies. Our agent-based model of the FX market comprises heterogeneous trading agents that employ a strategy that identifies and responds to periodic patterns in the price time series. We use the agent-based model of the FX market to undertake a systematic exploration of its constituent elements and their impact on the stylized facts (statistical patterns) of transactions data. This enables us to identify a set of sufficient conditions that result in the emergence of the stylized facts similarly to the real market data, and formulate a model that closely approximates the stylized facts.

Extracting valuable information from the large data is very urgent. However, because of some limitations such as memory restrictions, data complexity or time complexity, the majority of traditional data mining methods are time consuming and low efficiency working on big data. In contrast, parallel computing is a common and reliable choice to solve that problem. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy rule discovery algorithm - fuzzy rule based classification system in the framework of MapReduce (FRBCS-MR). The proposed FRBCS-MR algorithm applies parallel computing technology to extract fuzzy rules and build fuzzy rule-base, which combines the advantage of dealing with uncertainty of fuzzy system and the ability of MapReduce in parallel computing. Future goods trading has been gradually transformed from the original manual trading to stylized trading and the stylized trading is considered to be the forefront and the most scientific mode of investment.

Therefore, a reliable method to appraise the asset performance is extremely important to portfolio managers, regulators, and individual investors. One alternative approach to achieve this goal is data envelopment analysis (DEA). Asset performance was ranked from both self- and peer-evaluation perspectives. Specifically, we extended the cross-efficiency analysis in DEA that uses row and column means to portfolio selection and identify different types of asset set. This classification process can help investors to construct a more robust portfolio.

Traditional learning-based approaches collect all samples during the training period as the learning materials. The major contribution of this paper is to collect a subset of similar historical financial data to train the real-time trading model. This goal can be achieved by an on-line learning technique which is required to calculate an accurate model with training time limitation. In addition, the proposed joint-AdaBoost algorithm is to improve the system performance based on the concept of paired feature learning and planar weak classifier design. The core execution components in this algorithm can be further accelerated with the aid of Open Computing Language (OpenCL) parallel computing platform. The experimental results show that the proposed learning algorithm can improve the prediction accuracy of final classifier from 53.8% to 61.68%. Compared to the pure CPU implementation, the OpenCL version which uses CPU and GPGPU simultaneously can reduce the calculation time around 83.02 times.

First, the parameters of the corresponding Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process are estimated by auto-regressive Hidden Markov Models (AR-HMM), in order to capture the underlying characteristics of the financial time series. Portfolio optimization is then performed by maximizing the return achieved with a predefined probability instead of optimizing the predictability parameter, which provides more profitable portfolios. The selection of the optimal portfolio according to the goal function is carried out by stochastic search algorithms. The presented solutions satisfy the cardinality constraint in terms of providing a sparse portfolios which minimize the transaction costs (and, as a result, maximize the interpretability of the results). In order to use the method for high frequency trading (HFT) we utilize a massively parallel GPGPU architecture. Both the portfolio optimization and the model identification algorithms are successfully tailored to be running on GPGPU to meet the challenges of efficient software implementation and fast execution time. The performance of the new method has been extensively tested both on historical daily and intraday FOREX data and on artificially generated data series.

And all this data and trading activity has impact among themselves, thus a tight relative timing between different sites in finance trading is mandatory. In the Finance sector the requirements of different actors may be different: transferring legal time from certified institutions to trading centers, time synchronization at a data center scale, deterministic timing for finely coordinated trading actions at a global scale, etc. Our contribution describes how to distribute deterministically a global notion of time across an optical fiber network to arrive at a tight relative timing (accurate time synchronization among the network elements). Another use case is related to low latency which is a highly demanded feature in specific segments (e.g. reduction in exchange latency improves market quality). Latency is a necessary condition for the implementation of various types of strategies and low latency automated trading is associated with lower quoted and effective spreads, lower volatility and greater liquidity. We describe how we can use latency control mechanisms for evaluating it in the framework of a service level agreement.

Previous work has shown that the duration of overshoot events is on average twice the duration of a DC event. However, this was empirically observed on the specific currency pairs DC was tested with, and only under the specific time periods the tests took place. Thus, this observation is not easily generalised. In this paper, we build on this regularity, by creating a new event-based indicator. We do this by calculating the average duration time of overshoot events on each training set of each individual dataset we experiment with. This allows us to have tailored duration values for each dataset. Such knowledge is important, because it allows us to more accurately anticipate trend reversal. In order to take advantage of this new indicator, we use a genetic algorithm to combine different DC trading strategies, which use our proposed indicator as part of their decision-making process. We experiment on 5 different foreign exchange currency pairs, for a total of 50 datasets. Our results show that the proposed algorithm is able to outperform its predecessor, as well as other well-known financial benchmarks, such as a technical analysis. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Algorithmic trading; Directional changes; Financial forecasting; Genetic algorithms"

While the recent advance of portfolio selection in HFT market generates more profit, it yields much contended OLTP workloads. Featuring in exploiting the abundant parallelism, transaction pipeline, the state-of-the-art concurrency control (CC) mechanism, however suffers from limited concurrency confronted with HFT workloads. Its variants that enable more parallel execution by leveraging find-grained contention information also take little effect. To solve this problem, we for the first time observe and formulate the source of restricted concurrency as harmful ordering of transaction statements. To resolve harmful ordering, we propose PARE, a pipeline-aware reordered execution, to improve application performance by rearranging statements in order of their degrees of contention. In concrete, two mechanisms are devised to ensure the correctness of statement rearrangement and identify the degrees of contention of statements respectively. Experiment results show that PARE can improve transaction throughput and reduce transaction latency on HFT applications by upto an order of magnitude than the state-of-the-art CC mechanism. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",

Based on a unique data set from an electronic foreign exchange trading platform, OANDA FXTrade, we find that investors' future order flow is (significantly) driven by past price movements and that these predictive patterns last up to several hours. This observation clearly shows that for high-frequency trading, investors rely on previous price movements in making future investment decisions.We provide clear evidence that market and limit orders flows are much more predictable if those orders are submitted to close an existing position than if they are used to open one.

Compared with traditional fixed-price model, market-oriented trading mechanism such as auction demonstrates greater promise for resource pricing and allocation in clouds due to its adaptability and flexibility. In this paper, we focus on the competitive and bidding scenario among independent users in an auction-based IaaS market. Participants have different composite service demands and they adjust their bidding prices during the trading with the aim of obtaining appropriate amount of resources to maximize their profits. We formulate this scenario as a dynamic noncooperative game with incomplete information and propose a feedback-based distributed bidding adjustment approach to find the approximated optimal bids (i.e. Nash Equilibrium) for each user so as to achieve a fair and multi-win resources allocation outcome in the whole market. Our experimental investigation showed that with the help of our agent-based automated trading model and distributed bidding algorithms, the Nash equilibrium state of the cloud resource allocation game can be reached efficiently within an acceptable time, and the optimal bidding prices of each user could be obtained at the same time. © 2016 IEEE.","Auction; Cloud computing; Game theory; Infrastructure as a Service; Nash equilibrium; Resource allocation"

The proposed DNB allows simultaneously to represent expert knowledge of skilled traders in a model structure and to learn computationally from data information that reflects relevant market sentiment dynamics. The DBN is derived from a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) that incorporates expert knowledge in its design and learns the trend patterns present in the market data. The wavelet representation is used to produce compact representations of the LOB liquidity dynamics that simultaneously reduces the time complexity of the computational learning and improves its precision. In previous works, this trading strategy has been shown to be competitive when compared with conventional techniques. However, these works failed to control for unwanted dependencies in the return series used for training and testing that may have skewed performance results to the positive side. This paper constructs key trading strategy estimators based on the Random Entry Protocol over the USD-COP data. This technique eliminates unwanted dependencies on returns and order flow while keeps the natural autocorrelation structure of the LimitOrder Book (LOB). It is still concluded that the HHMM-based model results are competitive with a positive, statistically significant P/L and a well-understood risk profile.

"Portfolio of global futures algorithmic trading strategies for best out-of-sample performance","10.1007/978-3-319-39426-8_33","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978208927&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-39426-8_33&partnerID=40&md5=30b0dade04fcf04457b2c9db4948685c","We investigate two different portfolio construction methods for two different sets of algorithmic trading strategies that trade global futures. The problem becomes complex if we consider the out-of-sample performance. The Comgen method blindly optimizes the Sharpe ratio, and Comsha does the same but gives priority to strategies that individually have the better Sharpe ratio. It has been shown in the past that high Sharpe ratio strategies tend to perform better in out-of-sample periods. As the benchmark method, we use an equally weighted (1/N, naïve) portfolio. The analysis is performed on two years of out-of-sample data using a walk forward approach in 24 independent periods. We use the mean reversion and trend following datasets consisting of 22,702 and 36,466 trading models (time series), respectively. We conclude that Comsha produces better results with trend-following methods, and Comsha performs the same as Comgen with other type of strategies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Algorithmic trading; Comgen; Comsha; Optimization; Portfolio construction; Sharpe ratio"

One clab abets' price performance is usually affected by movements of other clabes of abets. However, the relationship between them is hard to trace and predict along with increase in complexity of markets' behaviors these days. Nothing like stock market, money or bond market is an over-the-counter market, where abets' prices are often presented in the form of clabes of discrete quotations by trader's subjective judgments, thus are hard to model and analyze. Given concern to this, we define the Type 2 fuzzy random variable (T2 fuzzy random variable) to quantify those bid/offer behaviors in this paper. Moreover, we build a T2 fuzzy random support vector regrebion (T2-FSVR)scheme to study relationships between these markets, thus form an effective trading strategy to predict the trend of market prices. We use matlab platform to implement and test the effectiveneb of the new model, then train and test it with 2014 whole years price data of bond and money markets. We also compare T2-FSVRs prediction accuracy with type-2 fuzzy expected regrebion(T2-FER) and confidence-interval-based fuzzy random regrebion model(CI-FRRM). The result shows that T2-FSVR outperforms and has 98% accuracy while CI-FRRM has 81% accuracy and T2-FER has only 70% accuracy. Moreover,T2-FSVR can be developed into a automated trading strategy for practical busineb use, which is able to learn behaviors of different markets based on mab of available historical and real time data and earn profit automatically. © 2016 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.","Creditability theory; Financial market; Quantitative investment; Support vector regrebion model; Type-2 fuzzy random variable; Type-reduction"

Recently, automated prediction markets where software trading agents perform market operations such as trading and updating beliefs on behalf of humans have been proposed. A challenging aspect in automated prediction markets is to develop suitable techniques that can be used by automated trading agents to update the price at which they should trade securities related to an event so that they can increase their profit. This problem is nontrivial, as the decision to trade and the price at which trading should occur depends on several dynamic factors, such as incoming information related to the event for which the security is being traded, the belief-update mechanism and risk attitude of the trading agent, and the trading decision and trading prices of other agents. To address this problem, we have proposed a new behavior model for trading agents based on a game-theoretic framework called partially observable stochastic game with information (POSGI). We propose a correlated equilibrium (CE)-based solution strategy for this game that allows each agent to dynamically choose an action (to buy or sell or hold) in the prediction market. We have also performed extensive simulation experiments using the data obtained from the Intrade prediction market for four different prediction markets. Our results show that our POSGI model and CE strategy produces prices that are strongly correlated with the prices of the real prediction markets. Results comparing our CE strategy with five other strategies commonly used in similar market show that our CE strategy improves price predictions and provides higher utilities to the agents compared to other existing strategies. © 2015 ACM 2157-6904/2015/07-ART48 $15.00.","Correlated equilibrium; Prediction market; Risk-averse traders; Stochastic game"

The universal strategy is compared with the class of strategies that compute the amount of bought or sold units of a financial instrument made in each step of trading by means of continuous functions of input information. The universal strategy makes decisions based on the forecasts of future prices of financial instruments with the help of the randomized algorithm for computing well-calibrated forecasts in Dawid’s sense. The given algorithm is the development of the Kakade and Foster theory and is combined with the similar forecasting method suggested by V.G. Vovk.

Suppose trader B trades less than trader A. Other things equal, trader B is more efficient than trader A because trader B attains the same SR as trader A with less trading time. Trader B's efficiency is not apparent when annualized SR (ASR) formulas are extended to high-frequency trading (HFT). In this chapter, we show how the pantheon of modified SRs in the literature could be adjusted by a single factor, which identifies trader efficiency via adaptive HFT stock price dynamics and cycle lengths for maximal alpha. Specifically, we derive a directing process for HFT trade strategy, which jumps positively only when the trader executes a successful trade or stays flat otherwise. We identify a simple intuitively appealing summary statistic, which can be extrapolated from publicly available data, and which serves as the single factor for modifying ASR to get an efficient Sharpe ratio (ESR). Application to risk and return data for HFT in Baron et al. (2014) finds that the ESR for aggressive HFT is 1.15, medium HFT is 2.88, and passive HFT is 1.43. Those ESRs for HFT numbers are equivalent to reported SR estimates for hedge funds multistrategy, convertible option arbitrage, and fund of fund strategies. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

As introduced by Lehmann, in an information regime all the information is trade related, arrives via order flow, and the fundamental value that underlines the prices does not change, it is simply translated by the size of the executed market order and the backfilling adjustment. During an information regime the best quotes and the underlying values follow a path defined by the limit order book. This implies that algorithmic trading gains can be strengthened not only by identifying these information regimes but also by forecasting the transition periods between regimes that signal fundamental changes in assets' prices, trading behavior, and optimal trading strategies. Our results show that the discovery and identification of information regimes essentially uncover the mechanism by which latent demands are translated into realized prices and volumes and, from here, that they can be used by professional traders. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

To better understand the societal implications of algorithmic trading, I construct computational agent-based models comprised of investors and algorithmic traders. I examine two overlapping types of algorithmic traders: high-frequency traders, who exploit speed advantages for profit, and market makers, who facilitate trade and supply liquidity by simultaneously maintaining offers to buy and sell. I employ simulation and empirical game-theoretic analysis to study trader behavior in equilibrium, that is, when all traders best- respond to their environment and other agents' strategies. I focus on the impact of algorithmic trading on allocative efficiency, or overall gains from trade, and the potential for a call market, in which orders are matched to trade at periodic intervals, to mitigate the latency advantages of high- frequency traders.

In the previous study, we built an artificial market model and investigated for the impact of non-position-based market maker’s spread to the markets’ shares of trading volumes. However it had the serious problem that the non-position-based market maker is too simple to manage its own position properly and so we could not judge weather the result of previous study is correct or not. Thus in this study, we made a position-based market maker and explored the competition, in terms of taking markets’ shares of trading volumes, between two artificial financial markets that have exactly the same specifications except existing a market maker, the non-position-based market maker or the position-based market maker. As a result, we found that the position-based market maker can acquire the share of trading volumes from the competitor even though its spread is bigger than bid-offer-spread of the competitor. Moreover, we revealed that position-based market maker can get a profit even in the situation that its spread or tick sizes of the stock exchanges are small. In addition to that, position-based market maker made a profit in almost all experiments which we conducted in this research by changing its spread and tick sizes of markets. At last, we confirmed that position-based market maker can manage its position properly compared to non-position-based market maker. In conclusion, the position-based market maker can not only supply liquidity to stock exchanges and contribute to acquire the share from the competitor as well as the non-position-based market maker does, but also manage its own position properly and make a profit. © 2015, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

It is very common in practice that the same problems emerge in different application domains (e.g. the modeling support for complex event processing is desirable in the domain of algorithmic trading, IT security assessment, robust monitoring, etc.). A DSL operates in one single domain, but the above-mentioned cross-domain challenges raise the question: is it possible to automate the design of DSLs which are so closely related? This approach demonstrates how a family of domain-specific languages can be developed for multiple domains from a single generic language metamodel with generative techniques. The basic idea is to refine the targeted domain with separating the problem domain from the context domain. This allows designing a generic language based on the problem and customizing it with the appropriate extensions for arbitrary contexts, thus defining as many DSLs and as many contexts as one extends the generic language for. The authors also present an ontology-based approach for establishing contextspecific domain knowledge bases. The results are discussed through a case study, where a language for event processing is designed and extended for multiple context domains. © 2014 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.",

The base-8 digital coding sequence, which is capable of revealing contrasting aggregation against sparsity of extreme events, is further compressed into a shortened sequence of state transitions. This compressed digital code sequence vividly demonstrates that the aggregation of large absolute returns is the primary driving force for stimulating both the aggregations of large trading volumes and transaction numbers. The state of system-wise synchrony is manifested with very frequent recurrence in the stock dynamics. And this data-driven dynamic mechanism is seen to correspondingly vary as the global market transiting in and out of contraction-expansion cycles. These results not only elaborate the stock dynamics of interest to a fuller extent, but also contradict some classical theories in finance. Overall this version of stock dynamics is potentially more coherent and realistic, especially when the current financial market is increasingly powered by high-frequency trading via computer algorithms, rather than by individual investors. © 2014 Fushing et al.",

However, the realworld time series, such as those fromnancial markets, are typically taken at irregular time intervals. It is a common practice to resample or bin the irregular time series into a regular one, but there are significant limitations on this practice. For example, if one is to resample the trading activities of a stock into hourly series, then the time series can only last through the trading day, because there usually is no trading in the night. In this work, we explore the dynamics of irregular time series through a high-performance computing algorithm known as Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT).To illustrate its effectiveness, we apply NUFFT on the trading records of natural gas futures contracts for the last seven years. Tests show that NUFFT results accurately capture well-known structural features in the trading records, such as weekly and daily cycles. At the same time the results also reveal unexplored features, such as the presence of multiple power laws. In particular, we observe an emerging power law in the Fourier spectra in recent years. We also detect a strong Fourier component at the precise frequency once per minute, which implies significant automated trading activities might be triggered by clock. © 2014 IEEE.",

Advanced data feed and audit trail information from market operators now make the full observation of market participants' actions possible. A key question is the extent to which it is possible to understand and characterize the behavior of individual participants from observations of trading actions. In this paper, we consider the basic problems of categorizing and recognizing traders (or, equivalently, trading algorithms) on the basis observed limit orders. Our approach, which is based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), is to model trading decisions as a Markov decision process and then use observations of an optimal decision policy to find the reward function. The approach strikes a balance between two desirable features in that it captures key empirical properties of order book dynamics and yet remains computationally tractable. Making use of a real-world data set from the E-Mini futures contract, we compare two principal IRL variants, linear IRL and Gaussian process IRL. Results suggest that IRL-based feature spaces support accurate classification and meaningful clustering. © 2014 IEEE.","Algorithmic Trading; Behavioral Finance; Gaussian Process; High Frequency Trading; Inverse Reinforcement Learning; Markov Decision Process; Support Vector Machine"

Using the uncertainty framework, the paper develops an uncertain fuzzy credibility regression model in the form of a linear and quadratic CAPM in order to estimate these performance skills. Using the probability framework the paper implements frequentist and Bayesian CAPMs (linear and quadratic) to estimate the same performance skills. We consider a data set of monthly investment style indices published by Hedge Fund Research group. The data set extends from January 1995 to June 2010. We divide this sample period into four overlapping sub-sample periods that contain different market trends. Using the probability framework, our results show that bounded rationality triggers inefficiencies in the market that fund managers can utilise to outperform the market. This market outperformance is due to selectivity and market timing skill during periods of economic recovery only. We admit that these results contradict the rational expectations model. However, with the uncertainty framework this effect disappears on behalf of the rational expectations model and the efficient market hypothesis. This disappearance may be a result of the increased amount of high frequency trading witnessed recently that has made market inefficiencies, which are the main source of hedge fund performance, rarer.","Hedge fund performance analysis; Probability and uncertainty models"

"Accelerating option risk analytics in R using GPUs",,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901829715&partnerID=40&md5=216c7760cfb3ba8b8ae1fbc2ecc2caf6","Broadly, a major prerequisite for analytics applications is robustness to modeling idiosyncrasies. As a result, there is a demand for comprehensive model exploration and validation in high level statistical programming environments such as R. Many financial applications require on-demand processing, which in turn requires fast modeling and calibration computations. In this paper we describe our work on speeding up the calibration of a Heston stochastic volatility model, a financial application, on GPUs. The Heston volatility model is used extensively across the capital markets to price and measure the market risk of exchange traded financial options. However, a typical R based implementation of the Heston model calibration on a CPU does not meet the performance requirements for sub-minute level trading, i.e. mid to high frequency trading. The calibration of a Heston model is performed over M option data points which remains fixed during the calibration computation. The most computation intensive part of this computation is the ErrorFunction() which estimates the error between market observed and model option prices. We have implemented the ErrorFunction() using a Map-Reduce design pattern leading to efficient implementation on various architectures including GPUs. In this paper, we describe the implementation of a GPU optimized kernel for this computation that can be called by the R script performing the calibration process. For M = 1024 we demonstrate a factor of 760x improvement in the overall calibration time over the R sequential implementation by off-loading ErrorFunction() on a system with an Intel Core i5 processor and NVIDIA Tesla K20c (Kepler architecture) consisting of 2496 cores. Note that not all the performance gain is due to the GPU- partly it is due to the reduction in the overhead of R for the Heston model calculation. For comparison we also implemented the calibration code using C/C + +. We observed a speed up of 230x for the GPU based implementation over the C/C + + indicating that a factor of 3.4x improvement is due to avoiding the R overhead for the Heston model calculation. However, the overall calibration time using R based optimization routines combined with the GPU off-loaded ErrorFunction() is comparable to a C/C + + GPU based calibration code.","Calibration; Financial option modeling; GPGPU computing; R"

Most trading systems have concentrated on using common analytic waveforms and have not taken into consideration phasors and complex variables. The Hilbert transform, often employed to convert signal variables in analytic waveforms to complex variables, will be used for the measurement of market cycles, rather than measurement of market trends. The main objective is to investigate how the periods of the dominant cycle in a cycle mode can be quantified in order to create an amplitude compensation of the In-Phase and Quadrature components, alongside methods of smoothing and de-trending the analytic signal. The subsequent output can be defuzzified using Type 2 Fuzzy-Logic techniques, which will in turn refine the implementation of trading strategies. Type-2 Fuzzy Logic systems are becoming more popular as they account for uncertainties that are not captured within a Type-1 Fuzzy Logic system. These Type-2 systems outperform traditional Fuzzy Logic systems in forecasting problems since they can account for more variables in a more efficient way. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In the presence of the bid-ask spread, the gain is smaller but it still ranges in the interval 2-6 percent in 6 months without using any leverage.

The paper applies the method to the high-frequency data of CSI 300 Index and the Futures and classifies the buying and selling orders through volume clock. The price risks are decomposed into a component driven by the impact of liquidity demand shocks (flow-driven risks (FDRs)) and a component driven by external information (information-driven risks (IDRs)). Findings – The empirical results show that the flow-driven risk of CSI 300 Index Futures is about 20 percent. In addition, before the introduction of the Index Futures, there is no asymmetric effect between liquidity demand shocks and price shocks existing in either CSI 300 Index or CSI 300 Index Futures. While after the introduction of stock Index Futures, the asymmetric effect in the both two markets emerges. The impact of the buying net order flows on the price is less than the impact of the selling net order flows on CSI 300 Index, whereas the impact of the buying net order flows on the price is larger than the impact of the selling net order flows on CSI 300 Index Futures. The paper further analyzes the relationship between liquidity and FDR and gets the conclusion that the reasons for the deterioration of the liquidity level are caused by the impact of the external information shocks, rather than the liquidity demand shocks. And entries of HFTs like arbitrage traders and hedge traders play a positive role in improving the liquidity level in the market. Originality/value – The paper introduces an asymmetric ITH method for the first time and finds asymmetric effect of the net order flow on the return in both CSI 300 Index market and the corresponding Index Futures market. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","HFTs; Liquidity demand shocks; Price shocks"

This novel theoretical approach results in an estimator that is genuinely range-based on daily opening, high, low and closing data, unlike current estimators in the literature. The daily price jump at the opening is considered to be the result of the unobserved evolution of an after-hours virtual trading day. In comparison to an existing drift-independent estimator, we find that our estimator is actually more efficient when using a smaller number of data points, while for a larger number of points the efficiency of our estimator stays above 99% of the existing one.

The hereto paper compares two types of agent-based models, one with zero-intelligence traders and the other with intelligent traders in order to simulate the tick-by-tick high frequency trades on the stock market for the selected U.S. stocks. The simulations of the agent-based models are done with the help of Adaptive Modeler software application which uses the interaction of 2,000 heterogeneous agents to create a virtual stock market for the selected stock with the scope of forecasting the price. Within the intelligent agent-based model the population of agents is continuously adapting and evolving by using genetic programming in forming new agents by using the trading strategies of the best performing agents and replacing the worst performing agents in a process called breeding, while the zero-intelligence agent based model does not evolve, agents do not breed, and they trade in a random manner. After comparing the fitting of the two models with the real data, the results show that in almost all the cases the intelligent agent-based model performed better when compared to the zero-intelligence agent-based model, which could be interpreted as lower market efficiency, allowing for predictions of the stock market price, or even stock market manipulation. Also, the zero-intelligent agent-based model generates more trades and lower wealth for the population, compared to the intelligent agentbased model. The high-frequency data turns out to be very hard to simulate and analyse due to its particularities which differentiate them from daily data, as price changes are discrete, being multiples of the minimum price increment, the price changes not being independent.","Agent-based modeling; Double auction; Financial market; High frequency trading; Zero-intelligence traders"

As a matter of example, in automated trading systems a delay of 1 ms may be worth $1M. In addition, nowadays business decisions are made on the basis of increasing volumes of information, complicating the adoption of decisions on time. These requirements are common to those found in other real-time application domains. Consequently, adapting certain tools used in such domains may be a solution for business applications too. This paper draws several scenarios where middleware based solutions are justified, with particular insight on real-time behavior and control of QoS (Quality of Service) needs. More specifically, we provide certain guidelines to use OMG DDS (Data Distribution Service) as communications backbone in soft real-time business applications. DDS is a recent publish/subscribe middleware specification which provides mechanisms aimed at easing the creation of complex distributed applications such as those allowing the definition of content filters or tuning QoS parameters.

A good strategy should be profitable which includes identification of what to trade and how to trade. In this paper, we focus on the study of algorithmic trading strategy optimization and propose a strategy optimization model based on an initialized strategy pool. In order to get a better strategy, a mutual information entropy based clustering algorithm is employed to analyze the correlations among the stocks and a reward and punishment scheme is also set up for updating the latest transaction data in the strategy optimization process. Experimental results on several different groups of stocks showed that in most cases, this optimization model can find a profitable strategy swiftly. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

To train these engines they need large datasets of information with highly accurate timestamps that cover long periods with differing trading conditions. Thus, the demand for temporal news datasets beyond the point where full archives are available is increasing. Rebuilding the actual temporal news dataset that was transmitted to the market relies on merging multiple datasets, each with incomplete information and sometimes questionable quality. Doing so requires near duplicate detection in a very large dataset including news in many languages. This research is novel as in our scenario we are unaware of the language used in any given news article.

Under this approach to wealth maximization, automated trading focuses on the process determining directional trades for individual securities based upon the receipt and interpretation of new data. This paper presents a stochastic price formation algorithm that implements a cognitive decision making system modeled by twin radial basis function artificial neural networks to produce a high frequency automated trading system for individual equity securities listed on U.S. exchanges. The overall effectiveness and efficiency of the automated trading system is calibrated by estimating non-parametric quasi elasticity coefficients for individual firm fundamental characteristics. We find that automation driven by cognitive science can effectively auto-trade securities and produce changes to individual wealth that equals or exceeds the performance generated by a simple buy-and-hold strategy. We also identify four fundamental firm factors that explain the ability of the automated trading algorithm to produce a measured level of percent-positive trades. © Izmir University of Economics, Turkey, 2010.","Artificial neural networks; Automated trading; Cognitive science; Stochastic models"

This largely explains the numerous technical indicators that rely on both volume and price data. The foreign exchange market is characterized by the liquidity it offers on large trades, the 24-hour access it provides to participants, the great number of traded currencies and the absence of a predetermined contract size. Leverage is readily accessible for the investor/hedger with margin requirements. Contrary to stocks, transaction costs are very small. Large operators are able to reduce brokerage fees and therefore incur mainly liquidity costs. Both the low transaction cost feature and the high liquidity of Forex allow for high-frequency trading, which would not be possible for other markets.

Trading involves the maintenance of effective business relationships, and is the complete process of: need identification, product brokering, supplier brokering, offer-exchange, contract negotiation, and contract execution. Three core technologies are needed to fully automate the trading process. First, real-time data mining technology to tap information flows and to deliver timely information at the right granularity. Second, intelligent agents that are designed to operate in tandem with the real-time information flows from the data mining systems. Third, virtual institutions in which informed trading agents can trade securely both with each other and with human agents in a natural way.

The ""information-based agency"" is being developed principally by John Debenham [UTS, Australia] and Carles Sierra [IIIA, Spain].

It defines the process by which information is transformed into an ontologically stable category of price. Reconstructing this sensemaking is a crucial task, since the settlement of prices for futures markets has significant organizational and economic consequences. And the recent emergence of electronic trading as an alternative to traditional ways of trading makes this issue more vivid. Futures exchanges have historically relied on a trading technology known as ""open outcry,"" where traders gather in a central physical location to buy and sell futures contracts on a range of physical and financial commodities. The organizational practices of open outcry produces prices deeply embedded in the interactions among these traders. Since the early 1990s, the technology of futures trading has been challenged by the introduction of electronic trading platforms. Automated trading systems shift the point of exchange from a centralized physical location to a decentralized network of terminals, located in investment banks and smaller boutique trading firms. With the elimination of the exchange trading floor and transformation of trading technology, the schemas and organizational settings that supported the creation of prices in open outcry have required renegotiation. This paper uses participant observation and interview data gathered on the trading floors of open outcry and electronic exchanges to investigate how sensemaking leads to the production of futures market prices.","Futures markets; Organizational sensemaking; Prices"

Markets for communication bandwidth, where organisations trade the rights to transmit data over a network, are one such application. Because demand fluctuates considerably every few seconds agent-based spot markets provide extra liquidity.
