By keeping traders in touch with world petroleum markets around the clock, ACCESS facilitates performance, availability and manageability in commodities trading. Being fully automated, traders could enter bid and asked prices on petroleum contracts from their workstations. ACCESS complies with stringent regulations for security, equal access to trades, reliability performance, and trader training certification. It has trader monitoring, auditing, and risk-management capabilities. Traders had equal access to any trade within 800 milliseconds. Most importantly, the system can be available end-to-end all the time.","Author Keywords":null}

Reports frequently note that \u2018power\u2019 goes to those who gain relevant trading information in marketing channels. The paper then asks whether and how structured or \u2018automated\u2019 trading information exchanges (e.g. electronic data interchange (EDI) links) between suppliers and wholesalers impact on their bargaining power in grocery marketing channels. This paper starts with the view that automated information exchanges favour the suppliers because they obtain trading information and gain marketing flexibility more than the wholesalers do. Focusing on the perspective of grocery wholesalers, the paper examines the relationships between (1) EDI use, (2) suppliers\u2019 incentives for EDI, (3) wholesalers\u2019 perceived bargaining power and (4) trust and cooperation between wholesalers and suppliers. Based on exploratory survey data from 33 grocery wholesalers, the paper finds that automated information exchanges may lower wholesalers' perceived bargaining power. It also shows that an appropriate level of incentives from suppliers tends to compensate for the power loss. This results in higher trust and cooperation in their trading relationships. \u00a9 2000, Association for Information Technology Trust. All rights reserved.","Author Keywords":null}

A TAG agent simulates one vision of future travel agents: it represents a set of clients in simultaneous auctions, trading complementary (e.g., airline tickets and hotel reservations) and substitutable (e.g., symphony and theater tickets) goods. RoxyBot faced two key technical challenges in TAG: (i) allocation-assigning purchased goods to clients at the end of a game instance so as to maximize total client utility, and (ii) completion-determining the optimal quantity of each resource to buy and sell given client preferences, current holdings, and market prices. For the dimensions of TAG, an optimal solution to the allocation problem is tractable, and RoxyBot uses a search algorithm based on Az.ast to produce optimal allocations. An optimal solution to the completion problem is also tractable, but in the interest of minimizing bidding cycle time, RoxyBot solves the completion problem using beam search, producing approximately optimal completions. RoxyBot's completer relies on an innovative data structure called a priceline.","Author Keywords":null}

In view of the intensive computational needs, it is common to use machine learning approaches on Sharpe ratio maximization for implementing dynamic portfolio optimization. In the literature, return-based approaches which directly used security prices or returns to control portfolio weights were often used. Inspired by the arbitrage pricing theory (APT), some other efforts concentrate on indirect modelling using hidden factors. On the other hand, with regard to the proper risk measure in the Sharpe ratio, downside risk was considered a better substitute for variance. In this paper, we investigate how the Gaussian temporal factor analysis (TFA) technique can be used for portfolio optimization. Since TFA is based on the classical APT model and has the benefit of removing rotation indeterminacy via temporal modelling, using TFA for portfolio management allows portfolio weights to be indirectly controlled by several hidden factors. Moreover, we extend the approach to some other variants tailored for investors according to their investment objectives and degree of risk tolerance. \u00a9 2003 Elsevier B.V.

It defines the process by which information is transformed into an ontologically stable category of price. Reconstructing this sensemaking is a crucial task, since the settlement of prices for futures markets has significant organizational and economic consequences. And the recent emergence of electronic trading as an alternative to traditional ways of trading makes this issue more vivid. Futures exchanges have historically relied on a trading technology known as \"open outcry,\" where traders gather in a central physical location to buy and sell futures contracts on a range of physical and financial commodities. The organizational practices of open outcry produces prices deeply embedded in the interactions among these traders. Since the early 1990s, the technology of futures trading has been challenged by the introduction of electronic trading platforms. Automated trading systems shift the point of exchange from a centralized physical location to a decentralized network of terminals, located in investment banks and smaller boutique trading firms. With the elimination of the exchange trading floor and transformation of trading technology, the schemas and organizational settings that supported the creation of prices in open outcry have required renegotiation. This paper uses participant observation and interview data gathered on the trading floors of open outcry and electronic exchanges to investigate how sensemaking leads to the production of futures market prices.","Author Keywords":"Futures markets; Organizational sensemaking; Prices"}

However, the efficiency and effectiveness of the trading decisions and investment strategies suggested by a computer based system are always being oppugned by researchers for abnegating the specialists' professional intermediary roles in traditional floor trading. Without proper validations, evaluations and comparisons, those valuable decision support systems can hardly be adopted trustily. This paper presents a Web-service-agents-based Securities Trading Simulation System (STSS) as a platform to validate, evaluate and compare the existing securities trading decision support systems by using the real world securities trading data from Chicago Stock Exchange. Agent technology is applied to deal with the complex, dynamic, and distributed securities trading processes. Web-services techniques are proposed for more interoperability and scalability in network-based business environment. By integrating agent technology with Web-services to make use of the advantages of both, this approach provides a more intelligent, flexible, and comprehensive platform to simulate the securities trading process. Performance of different decision support systems for securities trading can be validated, evaluated and compared either separately or simultaneously on a real time basis.","Author Keywords":"Decision support system; Intelligent agents; Securities trading simulation; Web-services"}

Trading involves the maintenance of effective business relationships, and is the complete process of: need identification, product brokering, supplier brokering, offer-exchange, contract negotiation, and contract execution. Three core technologies are needed to fully automate the trading process. First, real-time data mining technology to tap information flows and to deliver timely information at the right granularity. Second, intelligent agents that are designed to operate in tandem with the real-time information flows from the data mining systems. Third, virtual institutions in which informed trading agents can trade securely both with each other and with human agents in a natural way. This discussion focusses on the second technology the design of \"information driven\" trading agents. The \"information-based agency\" is being developed principally by John Debenham [UTS, Australia] and Carles Sierra [IIIA, Spain]. Published work to date has considered argumentation frameworks between a set of (often just two) agents, and has not taken into account the relationships that the various agents have with other agents. Drawing ideas from the business research literature we are constructing a model of multi-agent interaction that accommodates the sorts of inter-agent agreements found in the business world. The working hypothesis is that the information-based approach will prove to be a suitable conceptual framework through which networks of agents, interacting under the constraints of various styles of business relationship, may be implemented. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","Author Keywords":null}

In this paper, we address the problem of maintaining data integrity and confidentiality in web content delivery when dynamic content modifications are needed. We propose a flexible and scalable model for secure content delivery based on the use of roles and role certificates to manage web intermediaries. The proxies coordinate themselves in order to process and deliver contents, and the integrity of the delivered content is enforced using a decentralized strategy. To achieve this, we utilize a distributed role lookup table and a role-number based routing mechanism. We give an efficient secure protocol, iDeliver, for content processing and delivery, and also describe a method for securely updating role lookup tables. Our solution also applies to the security problem in web-based workflows, for example maintaining the data integrity in automated trading, contract authorization, and supply chain management in large organizations.

However, the root of this problem is not too much information; rather it is the fact that humans have limited attention spans to handle this information. Humans possess more processing power than computers but computers score over us in having almost unlimited attention spans. We must allocate our attention span in such a way as to maximize the information we obtain, given the constraint of our mental abilities. We have adopted a number of strategies to cope, like using intelligent search agents or spreading what attention we have thinly across as many information sources as possible (in other words skimming). The financial services industry, however, has adopted a radical approach: cut the human out of key parts of information acquisition and processing and use computers instead. This article argues that this approach could well spread to the wider business information market in the next few years. Far from being a threat, this could prove liberating for information professionals, allowing them to become more expert in specific industry sectors. The new breed of industry information portals, or community sites, will greatly aid in this transition and will build professional skills and efficiency.

In the early 80s, the need for interactions among companies and their trading partners led to the development of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) which for many years has been the most dependable way for companies to exchange B2B documents. However the deep learning curve and the cost of the required resources to support EDI prevented Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to adopt the technology in the automated trading processes. ebXML was introduced to overcome the excising shortcomings of EDI, but has its own limitations mainly reflected in its capability in providing decision support analysis and large scale concurrent applications. In this paper, a distributed user centric B2B gateway approach is presented to support trading partners. The gateway takes the leverages of services innovation integrating resources from traditional ebusiness environments with loosely coupled decision support resources to complete trading intelligently. The Australian retail sector has been chosen as an application domain in understanding the impact of the proposed solution. \u00a92008 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Decision support; ebXML; EDI; Integration; Services; SOA"}

Examples of streaming applications include security agencies processing data from communications media, battlefield management systems for military operations, consumer fraud detection based on on- line transactions, and automated trading based on finan- cial market data. Many stream processing applications are faced with the challenge of increasingly large volumes of data and the requirement to deliver low-latency responses predicated by analysis of that data. In this paper, we assess the applicability of the Blue Gene architecture for stream computing applications. This work is part of a larger effort to demonstrate the efficacy of using a Blue Gene for stream- ing applications. Blue Gene supercomputers provide a high-bandwidth low-latency network connecting a set of I\/O and compute nodes. We examine Blue Gene's suitability for stream com- puting applications by assessing its messaging capability for typical stream computing messaging workloads. In par- ticular, this paper presents results from micro-benchmarks we used to evaluate the raw performance of Blue Gene\/P (Blue Gene\/P) supercomputer under loads produced by high volumes of streaming data. We measure the perfor- mance of data streams that originate outside the supercom- puter, are directed through the I\/O nodes to the compute nodes and then terminate outside.

Innovative streaming applications are being developed in areas ranging from scientific applications (e.g., environment monitoring), to business intelligence (e.g., fraud detection and trend analysis), to financial markets (e.g., algorithmic trading strategies). Developing, understanding, debugging, and optimizing streaming applications is non-trivial because of the adaptive and dynamic nature of these applications. The sheer complexity and the distributed character of a large number of cooperating components hosted on a distributed environment further complicate matters. In this paper we describe Streamsight, a new visualization tool built to examine, monitor, and help understand the dynamic behavior of streaming applications. Previously developed stream processing visualization tools focus solely on composition of dataflow graphs. Streamsight's novelty hinges on a wide range of capabilities, including the ability to manage the dynamics of large and evolving topologies comprising multiple streaming applications with thousands of nodes and interconnections. From rendering live performance counters using different perspectives to allowing recordings and replays of the execution process, Streamsight provides the mechanisms that permit a better understanding of the evolving and adaptive behavior of streaming applications. These capabilities are used for debugging purposes, for performance optimization, and management of resources, including capacity planning. More than 50 developers, both inside and outside IBM, have been using Streamsight. \u00a9 2008 ACM.","Author Keywords":"Distributed processing; Dynamic visualization; Stream processing visualization; Visualizing topologies"}

During the course of each year's competition historical data is logged describing more than 800 games played by different agents from around the world. In this paper, we present analysis that is focused on determining which features of agent behavior, such as the average lead time requested for supplies or the average selling price offered on finished products, tend to differentiate agents that win from those that do not. We present a visual inspection of data from 16 games played in one bracket of the 2006 TAC SCM semi-final rounds. Plots of data from these games help isolate behavioral features that distinguish top performing agents in this bracket. We then introduce a metric based on information gain to provide a more complete analysis of the 80 games played in the 2006 TAC SCM quarter-final, semi-final and final rounds. The metric captures the amount of information that is gained about an agent's performance by knowing its value for each of 20 different behavioral features. Using this metric we find that, in the final rounds of the 2006 competition, winning agents distinguished themselves by their procurement decisions, rather than their customer bidding decisions. We also discuss how we used the analysis presented in this paper to improve our entry for the 2007 competition, which was one of the six finalists that year. \u00a9 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Author Keywords":"Agent performance analysis; Automated trading; Electronic commerce; Supply chain management; TAC SCM"}

By \u201cembedded\u201d we mean that the optimization algorithm is part of a larger, fully automated system, that executes automatically with newly arriving data or changing conditions, and without any human intervention or action. By \u201creal-time\u201d we mean that the optimization algorithm executes much faster than a typical or generic method with a human in the loop, in times measured in milliseconds or microseconds for small and medium size problems, and (a few) seconds for larger problems. In real-time embedded convex optimization the same optimization problem is solved many times, with different data, often with a hard real-time deadline. In this chapter we propose an automatic code generation system for real-time embedded convex optimization. Such a system scans a description of the problem family, and performs much of the analysis and optimization of the algorithm, such as choosing variable orderings used with sparse factorizations and determining storage structures, at code generation time. Compiling the generated source code yields an extremely efficient custom solver for the problem family. We describe a preliminary implementation, built on the Python-based modeling framework CVXMOD, and give some timing results for several examples.

The resulting fine-grain measurement demands cannot be met effectively by existing technologies, such as SNMP, NetFlow, or active probing. We propose instrumenting routers with a hash-based primitive that we call a Lossy Difference Aggregator (LDA) to measure latencies down to tens of microseconds and losses as infrequent as one in a million. Such measurement can be viewed abstractly as what we refer to as a coordinated streaming problem, which is fundamentally harder than standard streaming problems due to the need to coordinate values between nodes. We describe a compact data structure that efficiently computes the average and standard deviation of latency and loss rate in a coordinated streaming environment. Our theoretical results translate to an efficient hardware implementation at 40 Gbps using less than 1% of a typical 65-nm 400-MHz networking ASIC. When compared to Poisson-spaced active probing with similar overheads, our LDA mechanism delivers orders of magnitude smaller relative error; active probing requires 50-60 times as much bandwidth to deliver similar levels of accuracy.

The main concern in their execution is achieving the most efficient price. We propose two optimal strategies for the execution of atomic orders based on minimization of impact and volatility costs. The first considered strategy is based on a relatively simple nonlinear optimization model while the second allows re-optimization at some time point within a given execution time. In both cases a combination of market and limit orders is used. The key innovation in our approach is the introduction of a Fill Probability function which allows a combination of market and limit orders in the two optimization models we are discussing in this paper. Under certain conditions the objective functions of both considered problems are convex and therefore standard optimization tools can be applied. The efficiency of the resulting strategies is tested against two benchmarks representing common market practice on a representative sample of real trading data. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.","Author Keywords":"Algorithmic trading; Convex programming; Nonlinear programming; Optimal execution strategy"}

We introduce movement relative sensitivity to changes in S & P 500 values for each regional index, in order to better describe unidirectional changes. Results for unidirectional correlation and movement relative sensitivity show that these two indicators can be important factor in an investor decision making process.

Robert Hollebeek, professor of physics at the University of Pennsylvania, served as technical lead on the National Digital Mammography Archive (NDMA), a system designed to include a database growing by 28 petabytes per year. NDMA had to deal with issues related to siloed data stored on systems that were geographically distributed-a common problem among global enterprises. In an another development, Carl Olofson, IDC research vice president, Application Development and Deployment, highlights that fastest databases have direct access to a piece of information, in memory. Another example of an application that requires extreme speed is algorithmic trading driven by portfolios in the financial services industry. A promising solution is solid-state drives (SSDs) or flash memory, which now is a sandwiched tier between main memory and disk memory.","Author Keywords":null}

The general question is how to configure the behavior of bargaining agents to induce a socially optimal allocation. The literature contains many proposals for calculating a social welfare but the Nash welfare seems to be the one which has the most interesting properties for a fair agent society. It guarantees that all resources are fairly distributed among agents respecting their own preferences. This article shows first that the computation of this welfare is a difficult problem, contrary to common intuition. Many counter-examples describe the pitfalls of this resolution. In a second step, we describe our distributed multi-agent solution based on a specific agent's behavior and the results we get on difficult instances. We finally claim that this anytime solution is the only one able to effectively address this problem of obvious practical interest. \u00a9 2010 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Multi-agent system; Nash welfare; Negotiations; Resource allocation"}

To deal with high throughput and low response time requirements, these EP systems mainly use the CPU-RAM sub-system for data processing. However, as we show here, collected statistics on CPU usage or on CPU-RAM communication reveal that available systems are poorly optimized and grossly waste resources. In this paper we quantify some of these inefficiencies and propose cache-aware algorithms and changes on internal data structures to overcome them. We test the before and after system both at the microarchitecture and application level and show that: i) the changes improve microarchitecture metrics such as clocks-per-instruction, cache misses or TLB misses; ii) and that some of these improvements result in very high application level improvements such as a 44% improvement on stream-to-table joins with 6-fold reduction on memory consumption, and order-of-magnitude increase on throughput for moving aggregation operations. \u00a9 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Author Keywords":"Benchmarking; Complex Event Processing; Performance; Tuning"}

This paper highlights four properties of price-contingent trading that increase the frequency of such events. Price-contingent trading is common across financial market, since it includes algorithmic trading, technical trading, and dynamic option hedging. The four properties we consider are: (1) high kurtosis in the distribution of order sizes; (2) clustering of trades within the day; (3) clustering of trades at certain prices; and (4) feedback between trading and returns. The paper estimates the relative importance of these factors using data from the foreign exchange market. Calibrated simulations indicate that interactions among these factors are at least as important as any single one. Among individual factors, the orders' size distribution and feedback effects have the strongest influence. Overall, price-contingent trading could account for half of realized excess kurtosis. The paper suggests that extreme returns unaccompanied by news are statistically inevitable in the presence of price-contingent trading. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Crash risk; Exchange rates; Fat tails; High frequency; Jump process; Microstructure; Value-at-risk"}

Tick-by-tick data of six futures markets are herein considered, resulting in fat-tailed first-passage time probabilities. The scaling of the return with its standard deviation collapses the probabilities of all markets examined-and also for different time horizons-into single curves, suggesting that first-passage statistics is market independent (at least for high-frequency data). On the other hand, a very closely related quantity, the survival probability, shows, away from the center and tails of the distribution, a hyperbolic t -1 \/2 decay typical of a Markovian dynamics, albeit the existence of memory in markets. Modifications of the Weibull and Student distributions are good candidates for the phenomenological description of first-passage time properties under certain regimes.

Such views have to be kept fresh at low maintenance cost and latencies. At the same time, these views have to support classical SQL, rather than window semantics, to enable applications that combine current with aged or historical data. In this paper, we present viewlet transforms, a recursive finite differencing technique applied to queries. The viewlet transform materializes a query and a set of its higher-order deltas as views. These views support each other's incremental maintenance, leading to a reduced overall view maintenance cost. The viewlet transform of a query admits efficient evaluation, the elimination of certain expensive query operations, and aggressive parallelization. We develop viewlet transforms into a workable query execution technique, present a heuristic and cost-based optimization framework, and report on experiments with a prototype dynamic data management system that combines viewlet transforms with an optimizing compilation technique.

Stream processing is a paradigm well-suited for many modern data processing systems that ingest high-volume data streams from the real world, such as audio\/video streaming, high-frequency trading, and security monitoring. One attractive property of stream processing is that it lends itself to parallelization on multicores, and even to distribution on clusters when extreme scale is required. Stream processing has been co-evolved by several communities, leading to diverse languages with similar core concepts. Providing a common execution environment reduces language development effort and increases portability. We designed River as a practical realization of Brooklet, a calculus for stream processing. So at another level, this paper is about a journey from theory (the calculus) to practice (the execution environment). The challenge is that, by definition, a calculus abstracts away all but the most central concepts. Hence, there are several research questions in concretizing the missing parts, not to mention a significant engineering effort in implementing them. But the effort is well worth it, because using a calculus as a foundation yields clear semantics and proven correctness results.

Specifically, we address the question as to whether decisions to open or close a position are different when investors already hold a position compared with when they do not. Based on a unique data set from an electronic foreign exchange trading platform, OANDA FXTrade, we find that investors' future order flow is (significantly) driven by past price movements and that these predictive patterns last up to several hours. This observation clearly shows that for high-frequency trading, investors rely on previous price movements in making future investment decisions. We provide clear evidence that market and limit orders flows are much more predictable if those orders are submitted to close an existing position than if they are used to open one. We interpret this finding as evidence for the existence of a monitoring effect, which has implications for theoretical market microstructure models and behavioral finance phenomena, such as the endowment effect. \u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Author Keywords":"foreign exchange market; monitoring effect; order flow; trading activity data set"}

The common application pattern is that event processing agents publish events while other agents subscribe to events of interest.

To satisfy the need, researchers have proposed new architectures such as LDA and RLI that can provide fine-grained latency measurements. However, these architectures are fundamentally ossified in their design as they are designed to provide only a specific pre-configured aggregate measurement - -either average latency across all packets (LDA) or per-flow latency measurements (RLI). Network operators, however, need latency measurements at both finer (e.g., packet) as well as flexible (e.g., flow subsets) levels of granularity. To bridge this gap, we propose an architecture called MAPLE that essentially stores packet-level latencies in routers and allows network operators to query the latency of arbitrary traffic sub-populations. MAPLE is built using scalable data structures with small storage needs (uses only 12.8 bits\/packet), and uses a novel mechanism to reduce the query bandwidth significantly (by a factor of 17 compared to the naive method of sending packet queries individually). \u00a9 2012 ACM.","Author Keywords":"approximation; bloom filter; latency"}

As a matter of example, in automated trading systems a delay of 1 ms may be worth $1M. In addition, nowadays business decisions are made on the basis of increasing volumes of information, complicating the adoption of decisions on time. These requirements are common to those found in other real-time application domains. Consequently, adapting certain tools used in such domains may be a solution for business applications too. This paper draws several scenarios where middleware based solutions are justified, with particular insight on real-time behavior and control of QoS (Quality of Service) needs. More specifically, we provide certain guidelines to use OMG DDS (Data Distribution Service) as communications backbone in soft real-time business applications. DDS is a recent publish\/subscribe middleware specification which provides mechanisms aimed at easing the creation of complex distributed applications such as those allowing the definition of content filters or tuning QoS parameters. Unfortunately, DDS is a complex technology so the programmers of business applications may benefit from certain guidelines that help them in the identification of the topics as well as the values for the QoS parameters provided by DDS. \u00a9 2012 AISTI.","Author Keywords":"DDS core; Eventing; Middleware; Publish\/Subscribe; QoS"}

The parameter estimation problem can be solved by searching for a parameter set that maximises the log-likelihood. A core operation of this search process, the log-likelihood evaluation, is computationally demanding if the number of data points is large. To accelerate the computation, we present a log-likelihood evaluation strategy which is suitable for hardware acceleration.

The hereto paper compares two types of agent-based models, one with zero-intelligence traders and the other with intelligent traders in order to simulate the tick-by-tick high frequency trades on the stock market for the selected U.S. stocks. The simulations of the agent-based models are done with the help of Adaptive Modeler software application which uses the interaction of 2,000 heterogeneous agents to create a virtual stock market for the selected stock with the scope of forecasting the price. Within the intelligent agent-based model the population of agents is continuously adapting and evolving by using genetic programming in forming new agents by using the trading strategies of the best performing agents and replacing the worst performing agents in a process called breeding, while the zero-intelligence agent based model does not evolve, agents do not breed, and they trade in a random manner. After comparing the fitting of the two models with the real data, the results show that in almost all the cases the intelligent agent-based model performed better when compared to the zero-intelligence agent-based model, which could be interpreted as lower market efficiency, allowing for predictions of the stock market price, or even stock market manipulation. Also, the zero-intelligent agent-based model generates more trades and lower wealth for the population, compared to the intelligent agentbased model. The high-frequency data turns out to be very hard to simulate and analyse due to its particularities which differentiate them from daily data, as price changes are discrete, being multiples of the minimum price increment, the price changes not being independent.","Author Keywords":"Agent-based modeling; Double auction; Financial market; High frequency trading; Zero-intelligence traders"}

The paper applies the method to the high-frequency data of CSI 300 Index and the Futures and classifies the buying and selling orders through volume clock. The price risks are decomposed into a component driven by the impact of liquidity demand shocks (flow-driven risks (FDRs)) and a component driven by external information (information-driven risks (IDRs)). Findings \u2013 The empirical results show that the flow-driven risk of CSI 300 Index Futures is about 20 percent. In addition, before the introduction of the Index Futures, there is no asymmetric effect between liquidity demand shocks and price shocks existing in either CSI 300 Index or CSI 300 Index Futures. While after the introduction of stock Index Futures, the asymmetric effect in the both two markets emerges. The impact of the buying net order flows on the price is less than the impact of the selling net order flows on CSI 300 Index, whereas the impact of the buying net order flows on the price is larger than the impact of the selling net order flows on CSI 300 Index Futures. The paper further analyzes the relationship between liquidity and FDR and gets the conclusion that the reasons for the deterioration of the liquidity level are caused by the impact of the external information shocks, rather than the liquidity demand shocks. And entries of HFTs like arbitrage traders and hedge traders play a positive role in improving the liquidity level in the market. Originality\/value \u2013 The paper introduces an asymmetric ITH method for the first time and finds asymmetric effect of the net order flow on the return in both CSI 300 Index market and the corresponding Index Futures market. \u00a9 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Author Keywords":"HFTs; Liquidity demand shocks; Price shocks"}

At the same time, it allows to substantially reduce network communication, and, in contrast to previous approaches, it remains applicable when the data is non-stationary and shows rapid concept drift. The protocol is based on controlling the divergence of the local models in a decentralized way. Its beneficial properties are also confirmed empirically.","Author Keywords":null}

Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, OSNs can be used to harvest private user data, distribute malware, control botnets, perform surveillance, spread misinformation, and even influence algorithmic trading. Usually, an adversary starts off by running an infiltration campaign using hijacked or adversary-owned OSN accounts, with an objective to connect with a large number of users in the targeted OSN. In this article, we evaluate how vulnerable OSNs are to a large-scale infiltration campaign run by socialbots: bots that control OSN accounts and mimic the actions of real users. We adopted the design of a traditional web-based botnet and built a prototype of a Socialbot Network (SbN): a group of coordinated programmable socialbots. We operated our prototype on Facebook for 8 weeks, and collected data about user behavior in response to a large-scale infiltration campaign. Our results show that (1) by exploiting known social behaviors of users, OSNs such as Facebook can be infiltrated with a success rate of up to 80%, (2) subject to user profile privacy settings, a successful infiltration can result in privacy breaches where even more private user data are exposed, (3) given the economics of today's underground markets, running a large-scale infiltration campaign might be profitable but is still not particularly attractive as a sustainable and independent business, (4) the security of socially-aware systems that use or integrate OSN platforms can be at risk, given the infiltration capability of an adversary in OSNs, and (5) defending against malicious socialbots raises a set of challenges that relate to web automation, online-offline identity binding, and usable security. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Network operators today lack sufficient fine-grain measurement tools to detect, localize, and repair delay spikes that cause application service level agreement (SLA) violations. A recently proposed solution called LDA provides a scalable way to obtain latency, but only provides aggregate measurements. However, debugging application-specific problems requires per-flow measurements since different flows may exhibit significantly different characteristics even when they are traversing the same link. To enable fine-grained per-flow measurements in routers, we propose a new scalable architecture called reference latency interpolation (RLI) that is based on our observation that packets potentially belonging to different flows that are closely spaced to each other exhibit similar delay properties. In our evaluation using simulations over real traces, we show that while having small overhead, RLI achieves a median relative error of 12% and one to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than previous per-flow measurement solutions. We also observe RLI achieves as high accuracy as LDA in aggregate latency estimation, and RLI outperforms LDA in standard deviation estimation. \u00a9 1993-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Latency; Measurements; Per-flow; Router; Switch"}

Solutions employing long-running continuous queries executed in-memory show their limits in applications characterized by a staggering growth of available sources that continuously produce new events at high rates (e.g. intrusion detection systems and algorithmic trading). Problems arise due to the complexities in maintaining large amounts of events in memory for continuous elaboration, and due to the difficulties in managing at run-time the network of elaborating nodes. A batch approach to this kind of computation provides a viable solution for scenarios characterized by non frequent computations of very large time windows. In this paper we propose a model for batch processing in time window event computations that allows the definition of multiple metrics for performance optimization. These metrics specifically take into account the organization of input data to minimize its impact on computation latency. The model is then instantiated on Hadoop, a batch processing engine based on the MapReduce paradigm, and a set of strategies for efficiently arranging input data is described and evaluated.

We propose a simple model of latency arbitrage in which a single security is traded on two exchanges, with aggregate information available to regular traders only after some delay. An infinitely fast arbitrageur profits from market fragmentation by reaping the surplus when the two markets diverge due to this latency in cross-market communication. We develop a discrete-event simulation system to capture this processing and information transfer delay, and using an agent-based approach, we simulate the interactions between highfrequency and zero-intelligence trading agents at the millisecond level. We then evaluate allocative efficiency and market liquidity arising from the simulated order streams, and we find that market fragmentation and the presence of a latency arbitrageur reduces total surplus and negatively impacts liquidity. By replacing continuous-time markets with periodic call markets, we eliminate latency arbitrage opportunities and achieve further efficiency gains through the aggregation of orders over short time periods.

In closed systems - such as those found in HPC - Infiniband, iWARP or RoCE are common choices as system architects have the opportunity to choose the best host configurations and networking fabric. However, the vast majority of networks are built upon Ethernet with nodes exchanging data using the standard TCP\/IP stack. On such networks, achieving ultra low-latency while maintaining compatibility with a standard TCP\/IP stack is crucial. To date, most efforts for low-latency packet transfers have focused on three main areas: (i) avoiding context switches, (ii) avoiding buffer copies, and (iii) off-loading protocol processing. This paper describes IBM PowerENTM and its networking stack, showing that an integrated system design which treats Ethernet adapters as first class citizens that share the system bus with CPUs and memory, rather than as peripheral PCI Express attached devices, is a winning solution for achieving minimal latency. The work presents outstanding performance figures, including 1.30\u03bcs from wire to wire for UDP, usually the chosen protocol for latency sensitive applications, and excellent latency and bandwidth figures for the more complex TCP. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.","Author Keywords":null}

Significant technological investments have led to dramatic improvements in latency, the delay between a trading decision and the resulting trade execution. We describe a theoretical model for the quantitative valuation of latency. Our model measures the trading frictions created by the presence of latency, by considering the optimal execution problem of a representative investor. Via a dynamic programming analysis, our model provides a closed-form expression for the cost of latency in terms of well-known parameters of the underlying asset. We implement our model by estimating the latency cost incurred by trading on a human time scale. Examining NYSE common stocks from 1995 to 2005 shows that median latency cost across our sample roughly tripled during this time period. Furthermore, using the same data set, we compute a measure of implied latency and conclude that the median implied latency decreased by approximately two orders of magnitude. Empirically calibrated, our model suggests that the reduction in cost achieved by going from trading on a human time scale to a low latency time scale is comparable with other execution costs faced by the most cost efficient institutional investors, and it is consistent with the rents that are extracted by ultra-low latency agents, such as providers of automated execution services or high frequency traders. \u00a9 2013 INFORMS.","Author Keywords":null}

It is very common in practice that the same problems emerge in different application domains (e.g. the modeling support for complex event processing is desirable in the domain of algorithmic trading, IT security assessment, robust monitoring, etc.). A DSL operates in one single domain, but the above-mentioned cross-domain challenges raise the question: is it possible to automate the design of DSLs which are so closely related? This approach demonstrates how a family of domain-specific languages can be developed for multiple domains from a single generic language metamodel with generative techniques. The basic idea is to refine the targeted domain with separating the problem domain from the context domain. This allows designing a generic language based on the problem and customizing it with the appropriate extensions for arbitrary contexts, thus defining as many DSLs and as many contexts as one extends the generic language for. The authors also present an ontology-based approach for establishing contextspecific domain knowledge bases. The results are discussed through a case study, where a language for event processing is designed and extended for multiple context domains. \u00a9 2014 by IGI Global.

The bid-ask spread of the LOB is modeled by a tick-valued continuous-time Markov chain. We consider a small agent who continuously submits limit buy\/sell orders at best bid\/ask quotes, and may also set limit orders at best bid (resp. ask) plus (resp. minus) a tick for obtaining execution order priority, which is a crucial issue in high-frequency trading. The agent faces an execution risk since her limit orders are executed only when they meet counterpart market orders. She is also subject to inventory risk due to price volatility when holding the risky asset. The agent can then also choose to trade with market orders, and therefore obtain immediate execution, but at a less favorable price. The objective of the market maker is to maximize her expected utility from revenue over a short-term horizon by a trade-off between limit and market orders, while controlling her inventory position. This is formulated as a mixed regime switching regular\/impulse control problem that we characterize in terms of a quasi-variational system by dynamic programming methods. Calibration procedures are derived for estimating the transition matrix and intensity parameters for the spread and for Cox processes modelling the execution of limit orders. We provide an explicit backward splitting scheme for solving the problem and show how it can be reduced to a system of simple equations involving only the inventory and spread variables. Several computational tests are performed both on simulated and real data, and illustrate the impact and profit when considering execution priority in limit orders and market orders. \u00a9 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Author Keywords":"Applied mathematical finance; Market microstructure; Portfolio optimization; Quantitative finance techniques; Stochastic control; Trading strategies"}

We also design fully automated trading systems by combining the best-performing candlestick rules. No evidence of out-performance is found after transaction costs. Although Japanese candlesticks can somewhat predict intra-day returns on large US caps, we show that such predictive power is too limited for active portfolio management to outperform the buy-and-hold strategy when luck, risk, and trading costs are correctly measured. \u00a9 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Author Keywords":"Empirical time series analysis; Technical trading; Trading strategies; Trading systems"}

Optical fibres provide unsurpassed transmission bandwidth, but light propagates 31% slower in a silica glass fibre than in vacuum, thus compromising latency. Air guidance in hollow-core fibres can reduce fibre latency very significantly. However, state-of-the-art technology cannot achieve the combined values of loss, bandwidth and mode-coupling characteristics required for high-capacity data transmission. Here, we report a fundamentally improved hollow-core photonic-bandgap fibre that provides a record combination of low loss (3.5 dB km -1) and wide bandwidth (160 nm), and use it to transmit 37 \u00d7 40 Gbit s -1 channels at a 1.54 \u03bcs km -1 faster speed than in a conventional fibre.

However, a typical R based implementation of the Heston model calibration on a CPU does not meet the performance requirements for sub-minute level trading, i.e. mid to high frequency trading. The calibration of a Heston model is performed over M option data points which remains fixed during the calibration computation. The most computation intensive part of this computation is the ErrorFunction() which estimates the error between market observed and model option prices. We have implemented the ErrorFunction() using a Map-Reduce design pattern leading to efficient implementation on various architectures including GPUs. In this paper, we describe the implementation of a GPU optimized kernel for this computation that can be called by the R script performing the calibration process. For M = 1024 we demonstrate a factor of 760x improvement in the overall calibration time over the R sequential implementation by off-loading ErrorFunction() on a system with an Intel Core i5 processor and NVIDIA Tesla K20c (Kepler architecture) consisting of 2496 cores. Note that not all the performance gain is due to the GPU- partly it is due to the reduction in the overhead of R for the Heston model calculation. For comparison we also implemented the calibration code using C\/C + +. We observed a speed up of 230x for the GPU based implementation over the C\/C + + indicating that a factor of 3.4x improvement is due to avoiding the R overhead for the Heston model calculation. However, the overall calibration time using R based optimization routines combined with the GPU off-loaded ErrorFunction() is comparable to a C\/C + + GPU based calibration code.","Author Keywords":"Calibration; Financial option modeling; GPGPU computing; R"}

This protocol can be applied wherever a prediction-based service must be provided timely for each data point of a multitude of high frequency data streams, each of which is observed at a local node of some distributed system. Exemplary applications include social content recommendation and algorithmic trading. The challenge is to balance the joint predictive performance of the nodes by exchanging information between them, while not letting communication overhead deteriorate the responsiveness of the service. Technically, the proposed protocol is based on controlling the variance of the local models in a decentralized way. This approach retains the asymptotic optimal regret of previous algorithms. At the same time, it allows to substantially reduce network communication, and, in contrast to previous approaches, it remains applicable when the data is non-stationary and shows rapid concept drift. We demonstrate empirically that the protocol is able to hold up a high predictive performance using only a fraction of the communication required by benchmark methods. \u00a9 2014 Springer-Verlag.","Author Keywords":null}

In this article, we present the DBToaster system, which keeps materialized views of standard SQL queries continuously fresh as data changes very rapidly. This is achieved by a combination of aggressive compilation techniques and DBToaster's original recursive finite differencing technique which materializes a query and a set of its higher-order deltas as views. These views support each other's incremental maintenance, leading to a reduced overall view maintenance cost.

To create a low latency trading system, it is crucial to effectively build a representation of the market state (book) in hardware. Thus, we have designed a new hardware architecture, which updates the book with the best bid\/offer prices based on the incoming messages from the exchange. For each message a corresponding financial instrument needs to be looked up and its record needs to be updated. Proposed architecture is utilizing cuckoo hashing for the book handling, which enables low latency symbol lookup and high memory utilization. In this paper we discuss a trade-off between lookup latency and memory utilization. With average latency of 253 ns the proposed architecture is able to handle 119 275 instruments while using only 144 Mbit QDR SRAM. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.","Author Keywords":null}

It is very common in practice that the same problems emerge in different application domains (e.g. the modeling support for complex event processing is desirable in the domain of algorithmic trading, IT security assessment, robust monitoring, etc.). A DSL operates in one single domain, but the above-mentioned cross-domain challenges raise the question: is it possible to automate the design of DSLs which are so closely related? This approach demonstrates how a family of domain-specific languages can be developed for multiple domains from a single generic language metamodel with generative techniques. The basic idea is to refine the targeted domain with separating the problem domain from the context domain. This allows designing a generic language based on the problem and customizing it with the appropriate extensions for arbitrary contexts, thus defining as many DSLs and as many contexts as one extends the generic language for. The authors also present an ontology-based approach for establishing contextspecific domain knowledge bases. The results are discussed through a case study, where a language for event processing is designed and extended for multiple context domains. \u00a9 2014 by IGI Global.

Whether VPIN is more strongly correlated with volume or volatility depends on the exact implementation. Hence, it is crucial for the interpretation of VPIN as a harbinger of market turbulence or as a predictor of short-term volatility to control for current volume and volatility. Doing so, we find no evidence of incremental predictive power of VPIN for future volatility. Likewise, VPIN does not attain unusual extremes prior to the flash crash. Moreover, the properties of VPIN are strongly dependent on the underlying trade classification. In particular, using more standard classification techniques, VPIN behaves in the exact opposite manner of what is portrayed in ELO (2011a, 2012a). At a minimum, ELO should rationalize this systematic reversal as the classification becomes more closely aligned with individual transactions.ELO (2014) dispute our findings. This note reviews the econometric methodology and the market microstructure arguments behind our conclusions and responds to a number of inaccurate assertions. In addition, we summarize fresh empirical evidence that corroborates the hypothesis that VPIN is largely driven, and significantly distorted, by the volume and volatility innovations. Furthermore, we note there is compelling new evidence that transaction-based classification schemes are more accurate than the bulk volume strategies advocated by ELO for constructing VPIN. In fact, using perfect classification leads to diametrically opposite results relative to ELO (2011a, 2012a). \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Flash crash; High-frequency trading; Order flow toxicity; Order imbalance; PIN; VIX; Volatility forecasting; VPIN"}

The base-8 digital coding sequence, which is capable of revealing contrasting aggregation against sparsity of extreme events, is further compressed into a shortened sequence of state transitions. This compressed digital code sequence vividly demonstrates that the aggregation of large absolute returns is the primary driving force for stimulating both the aggregations of large trading volumes and transaction numbers. The state of system-wise synchrony is manifested with very frequent recurrence in the stock dynamics. And this data-driven dynamic mechanism is seen to correspondingly vary as the global market transiting in and out of contraction-expansion cycles. These results not only elaborate the stock dynamics of interest to a fuller extent, but also contradict some classical theories in finance. Overall this version of stock dynamics is potentially more coherent and realistic, especially when the current financial market is increasingly powered by high-frequency trading via computer algorithms, rather than by individual investors. \u00a9 2014 Fushing et al.","Author Keywords":null}

Currently, the tools of the news analytics have been increasingly used by traders in the U.S. and Europe. The interest in news analytics is related to the ability to predict changes of prices, volatility and trading volume on the stock market. The emphasis of the paper is on assessing the added value of using news analytics data in improving the explanatory power of the GARCH-Jump model. Based on empirical evidences for some of FTSE100 companies, the paper examines two GARCH models with jumps. First we consider the well-known GARCH model with autoregressive conditional jump intensity proposed in [1]. Then we introduce the GARCH-Jumps model augmented with news intensity and obtain some empirical results. The main assumption of the model is that jump intensity might change over time and that jump intensity depends linearly on the number of news (the news intensity). The comparison of the values of log likelihood supports the hypothesis of impact of news on the jump intensity of volatility.","Author Keywords":"GARCH models; News analytics; Stock volatility modelling"}

Using the uncertainty framework, the paper develops an uncertain fuzzy credibility regression model in the form of a linear and quadratic CAPM in order to estimate these performance skills. Using the probability framework the paper implements frequentist and Bayesian CAPMs (linear and quadratic) to estimate the same performance skills. We consider a data set of monthly investment style indices published by Hedge Fund Research group. The data set extends from January 1995 to June 2010. We divide this sample period into four overlapping sub-sample periods that contain different market trends. Using the probability framework, our results show that bounded rationality triggers inefficiencies in the market that fund managers can utilise to outperform the market. This market outperformance is due to selectivity and market timing skill during periods of economic recovery only. We admit that these results contradict the rational expectations model. However, with the uncertainty framework this effect disappears on behalf of the rational expectations model and the efficient market hypothesis. This disappearance may be a result of the increased amount of high frequency trading witnessed recently that has made market inefficiencies, which are the main source of hedge fund performance, rarer.","Author Keywords":"Hedge fund performance analysis; Probability and uncertainty models"}

The associated 'technological arms race' has created a new market ecology which has made trading cheaper and faster but more volatile and fragmented. This paper charts the technological roots of this transformation from a conventional measurement of innovation perspective. We do so by employing content analysis techniques and extracting market infrastructure patent counts from the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) database for the period January 1976 to October 2013. From the resulting time series and a qualitative examination of patents we find that (1) the number of market infrastructure patents has dramatically increased since 1999, as confirmed by an associated structural break; (2) the new market ecology has, in true Schumpeterian style, been associated with a new breed of firms, most notably software firms and historically smaller brokerage firms that have invested heavily in technology internally and through strategic acquisitions; and (3) some incumbent firms have responded aggressively to the new market ecology, most notably the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Goldman Sachs. We conclude that policymakers, regulators and academics wishing to further investigate the technological roots of recent changes in capital should refer to patent data. Our principal contribution is to highlight that Wall Street has been actively patenting market infrastructure innovations in a pattern consistent with claims that an associated 'technological arms race' started in the late 1990s. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Author Keywords":"Capital markets; Financial innovation; High frequency trading; Patents"}

Suppose trader B trades less than trader A. Other things equal, trader B is more efficient than trader A because trader B attains the same SR as trader A with less trading time. Trader B's efficiency is not apparent when annualized SR (ASR) formulas are extended to high-frequency trading (HFT). In this chapter, we show how the pantheon of modified SRs in the literature could be adjusted by a single factor, which identifies trader efficiency via adaptive HFT stock price dynamics and cycle lengths for maximal alpha. Specifically, we derive a directing process for HFT trade strategy, which jumps positively only when the trader executes a successful trade or stays flat otherwise. We identify a simple intuitively appealing summary statistic, which can be extrapolated from publicly available data, and which serves as the single factor for modifying ASR to get an efficient Sharpe ratio (ESR). Application to risk and return data for HFT in Baron et al. (2014) finds that the ESR for aggressive HFT is 1.15, medium HFT is 2.88, and passive HFT is 1.43.

Identifying and understanding the impact of algorithmic trading on financial markets has become a critical issue for market operators and regulators. Advanced data feeds and audit trail information from market operators now allow for the full observation of market participants\u2019 actions. A key question is the extent to which it is possible to understand and characterize the behaviour of individual participants from observations of trading actions. In this paper, we consider the basic problems of categorizing and recognizing traders (or, equivalently, trading algorithms) on the basis of observed limit orders. These problems are of interest to regulators engaged in strategy identification for the purposes of fraud detection and policy development. Methods have been suggested in the literature for describing trader behaviour using classification rules defined over a feature space consisting of summary trading statistics of volume and inventory, along with derived variables that reflect the consistency of buying or selling behaviour. Our principal contribution is to suggest an entirely different feature space that is constructed by inferring key parameters of a sequential optimization model that we take as a surrogate for the decision-making process of the traders. In particular, we model trader behaviour in terms of a Markov decision process. We infer the reward (or objective) function for this process from observations of trading actions using a process from machine learning known as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). The reward functions learned through IRL then constitute a feature space that can be the basis for supervised learning (for classification or recognition of traders) or unsupervised learning (for categorization of traders). Making use of a real-world data-set from the E-Mini futures contract, we compare two principal IRL variants, linear IRL and Gaussian Process IRL, against a method based on summary trading statistics. Results suggest that IRL-based feature spaces support accurate classification and meaningful clustering. Further, we argue that, because they attempt to learn traders\u2019 underlying value propositions under different market conditions, the IRL methods are more informative and robust than the summary statistic-based approach and are well suited for discovering new behaviour patterns of market participants. \u00a9 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Author Keywords":"Algorithmic trading; Behavioural finance; Gaussian process; High-frequency trading; Inverse reinforcement learning; Markov decision process; Support vector machine"}

As introduced by Lehmann, in an information regime all the information is trade related, arrives via order flow, and the fundamental value that underlines the prices does not change, it is simply translated by the size of the executed market order and the backfilling adjustment. During an information regime the best quotes and the underlying values follow a path defined by the limit order book. This implies that algorithmic trading gains can be strengthened not only by identifying these information regimes but also by forecasting the transition periods between regimes that signal fundamental changes in assets' prices, trading behavior, and optimal trading strategies. Our results show that the discovery and identification of information regimes essentially uncover the mechanism by which latent demands are translated into realized prices and volumes and, from here, that they can be used by professional traders. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the previous study, we built an artificial market model and investigated for the impact of non-position-based market maker\u2019s spread to the markets\u2019 shares of trading volumes. However it had the serious problem that the non-position-based market maker is too simple to manage its own position properly and so we could not judge weather the result of previous study is correct or not. Thus in this study, we made a position-based market maker and explored the competition, in terms of taking markets\u2019 shares of trading volumes, between two artificial financial markets that have exactly the same specifications except existing a market maker, the non-position-based market maker or the position-based market maker. As a result, we found that the position-based market maker can acquire the share of trading volumes from the competitor even though its spread is bigger than bid-offer-spread of the competitor. Moreover, we revealed that position-based market maker can get a profit even in the situation that its spread or tick sizes of the stock exchanges are small. In addition to that, position-based market maker made a profit in almost all experiments which we conducted in this research by changing its spread and tick sizes of markets. At last, we confirmed that position-based market maker can manage its position properly compared to non-position-based market maker. In conclusion, the position-based market maker can not only supply liquidity to stock exchanges and contribute to acquire the share from the competitor as well as the non-position-based market maker does, but also manage its own position properly and make a profit. \u00a9 2015, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

Commercial agencies have started developing their own filtered financial news feeds, which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. In this chapter, we use a high-frequency sentiment series, developed by TRNA, to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for DJIA stock index component companies. A variety of forms of this measure, namely, basic scores, absolute values of the series, squared values of the series, and the first differences of the series, are used to estimate three standard volatility models, namely, GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic), EGARCH (Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasctic), and GJR (Glosten, Jagganathan and Rundle (1993)). We use these alternative daily DJIA market sentiment scores to examine the relationship between financial news sentiment scores and the volatility of the DJIA return series. We demonstrate how this calibration of machine-filtered news can improve volatility measures. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Feed messages are often used in time-critical automated trading applications, and two identical feeds (A and B feeds) are provided in order to reduce message loss. A key challenge is to support A\/B line arbitration efficiently to compensate for missing packets, while offering flexibility for various operational modes such as prioritising for low latency or for high data reliability. This paper presents a reconfigurable acceleration approach for A\/B arbitration operating at the network level, capable of supporting any messaging protocol. Two modes of operation are provided simultaneously: one prioritising low latency, and one prioritising high reliability with three dynamically configurable windowing methods. We also present a model for message feed processing latencies that is useful for evaluating scalability in future applications. We outline a new low latency, high throughput architecture and demonstrate a cycle-accurate testing framework to measure the actual latency of packets within the FPGA. We implement and compare the performance of the NASDAQ TotalView-ITCH, OPRA and ARCA market data feed protocols using a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA. For high reliability messages we achieve latencies of 42ns for TotalView-ITCH and 36.75ns for OPRA and ARCA. 6ns and 5.25ns are obtained for low latency messages. The most resource intensive protocol, TotalView-ITCH, is also implemented in a Xilinx Virtex- 5 FPGA within a network interface card; it is used to validate our approach with real market data. We offer latencies 10 times lower than an FPGA-based commercial design and 4.1 times lower than the hardware-accelerated IBM PowerEN processor, with throughputs more than double the required 10Gbps line rate.

We show that competition in liquidity supply incentivizes the use of hidden orders to prevent losses due to over-bidding. Thus, because aggressive liquidity competition is more prevalent in liquid stocks, our model predicts that the proportion of hidden liquidity is higher in liquid markets. Our theoretical considerations ares supported by an empirical analysis using high-frequency order-message data from NASDAQ.

However, the cost of the parallelization process of existing applications is still too high in terms of time-to-development, and often requires a large effort and expertise by the programmer. The REPARA methodology consists in a systematic way to express parallel patterns by annotating the source code using C++11 attributes transformed automatically in a target parallel code based on parallel programming libraries (e.g. FastFlow, Intel TBB). In this paper we apply this approach in the parallelization of a real high-frequency trading application. The description shows the effectiveness of the approach in easily prototyping several parallel variants of the same code. We also propose an extension of a REPARA attribute to express a user-defined scheduling strategy, which makes it possible to design a high-throughput and low-latency parallelization of our code outperforming the other parallel variants in most of the considered test-cases. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"C++11 Attributes; Data Stream Processing; FastFlow; High-Frequency Trading; Parallel Patterns; REPARA"}

This is especially important for computational finance, where digital traces of human behaviour offer a great potential to drive trading strategies. We contribute to this by providing a consistent approach that integrates various datasources in the design of algorithmic traders. This allows us to derive insights into the principles behind the profitability of our trading strategies. We illustrate our approach through the analysis of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency known for its large price fluctuations. In our analysis, we include economic signals of volume and price of exchange for USD, adoption of the Bitcoin technology and transaction volume of Bitcoin. We add social signals related to information search, word of mouth volume, emotional valence and opinion polarization as expressed in tweets related to Bitcoin for more than 3 years. Our analysis reveals that increases in opinion polarization and exchange volume precede rising Bitcoin prices, and that emotional valence precedes opinion polarization and rising exchange volumes. We apply these insights to design algorithmic trading strategies for Bitcoin, reaching very high profits in less than a year. We verify this high profitability with robust statistical methods that take into account risk and trading costs, confirming the long-standing hypothesis that trading-based social media sentiment has the potential to yield positive returns on investment. \u00a9 2015 The Authors.","Author Keywords":"Algorithmic trading; Bitcoin; Computational social science; Polarization; Prediction; Sentiment"}

The two series are respectively related to the instantaneous volatility and the market liquidity; hence, they are particularly suited to test microstructure hypotheses. Design\/methodology\/approach: ALog-autoregressive conditional duration model was adopted to include the information on the traders\u2019 identity at the transaction level. High-frequency data were used and how the informed traders and the liquidity provider affect the arrival of market events was studied. The robustness of our results was also checked by testing different distributions and controlling for microstructure effects. Findings: It was found that informed traders and the liquidity provider exert a dominant role in accelerating the market activity. This result depends on the state of the market, i.e. it is effective only during periods of high frequency of transactions. The estimates for price durations show that a high instantaneous volatility can be mainly ascribed to a great concentration of informed traders. Informed traders are also found to shorten volume durations by clustering small-size orders to disguise their private signal. For both durations, the liquidity provider is also found to foster the market activity, likely because of his contractual duties. Originality\/value: The article is of interest for researchers in the field of market microstructure, as well as for specialists in the high-frequency trading. Results provide an empirical confirmation of information models which theorize an accelerating effect for informed trading. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first contribution to study the impact of traders\u2019categories at the transaction level and with different definitions of durations. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Author Keywords":"Euronext paris; Financial durations; Informed traders; Liquidity provider; Log-ACD model; Market microstructure"}

Compared with traditional fixed-price model, market-oriented trading mechanism such as auction demonstrates greater promise for resource pricing and allocation in clouds due to its adaptability and flexibility. In this paper, we focus on the competitive and bidding scenario among independent users in an auction-based IaaS market. Participants have different composite service demands and they adjust their bidding prices during the trading with the aim of obtaining appropriate amount of resources to maximize their profits. We formulate this scenario as a dynamic noncooperative game with incomplete information and propose a feedback-based distributed bidding adjustment approach to find the approximated optimal bids (i.e. Nash Equilibrium) for each user so as to achieve a fair and multi-win resources allocation outcome in the whole market. Our experimental investigation showed that with the help of our agent-based automated trading model and distributed bidding algorithms, the Nash equilibrium state of the cloud resource allocation game can be reached efficiently within an acceptable time, and the optimal bidding prices of each user could be obtained at the same time. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Auction; Cloud computing; Game theory; Infrastructure as a Service; Nash equilibrium; Resource allocation"}

One natural question, which has begun to spur the development of new models, is the effect of competition between platforms that use these two different mechanisms when agents can strategize over platform choice. In this paper we contribute to this nascent literature by developing an agent-based model of competition between a Call market and a CDA market. Our model incorporates patient informed traders (both high-frequency and not) who are willing to wait for order execution at their preferred price and impatient background traders who demand immediate execution. We show that there is a strong tendency for the Call market to absorb a significant fraction of trade under most equilibrium and approximate-equilibrium conditions. These equilibria typically lead to significantly higher welfare for the background traders, an important measure of social value, than the operation of an isolated CDA market.

Not only the collection and purification of multi-source data, the effective visualization of high-throughput data streams and rapid programmability on massively parallel processing architectures are widely used to facilitate the algorithmic trading and research. Big data analytics can help reveal more hidden market opportunities through analyzing high-volume structured data and social news, in contrast to the underperformers that are incapable of adopting novel techniques. Being able to process massive complex events in ultra-fast speed removes the roadblock for promptly capturing market trends and timely managing risks. These key trends in capital markets and extensive examples in quantitative finance are systematically highlighted in this chapter. The insufficiency of technological adaptation and the gap between research and practice are also presented. To clarify matters, the three natures of Big Data, volume, velocity and variety are used as a prism through which to understand the pitfalls and opportunities of emerged and emerging technologies towards financial services. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Author Keywords":null}

One clab abets' price performance is usually affected by movements of other clabes of abets. However, the relationship between them is hard to trace and predict along with increase in complexity of markets' behaviors these days. Nothing like stock market, money or bond market is an over-the-counter market, where abets' prices are often presented in the form of clabes of discrete quotations by trader's subjective judgments, thus are hard to model and analyze. Given concern to this, we define the Type 2 fuzzy random variable (T2 fuzzy random variable) to quantify those bid\/offer behaviors in this paper. Moreover, we build a T2 fuzzy random support vector regrebion (T2-FSVR)scheme to study relationships between these markets, thus form an effective trading strategy to predict the trend of market prices. We use matlab platform to implement and test the effectiveneb of the new model, then train and test it with 2014 whole years price data of bond and money markets. We also compare T2-FSVRs prediction accuracy with type-2 fuzzy expected regrebion(T2-FER) and confidence-interval-based fuzzy random regrebion model(CI-FRRM). The result shows that T2-FSVR outperforms and has 98% accuracy while CI-FRRM has 81% accuracy and T2-FER has only 70% accuracy. Moreover,T2-FSVR can be developed into a automated trading strategy for practical busineb use, which is able to learn behaviors of different markets based on mab of available historical and real time data and earn profit automatically. \u00a9 2016 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.","Author Keywords":"Creditability theory; Financial market; Quantitative investment; Support vector regrebion model; Type-2 fuzzy random variable; Type-reduction"}

Skyline queries are a notable example. Their results consist of all the tuples whose attribute vector is not dominated (in the Pareto sense) by one of any other tuple. Because of their popularity, skyline queries have been studied in terms of both sequential algorithms and parallel implementations for multiprocessors and clusters. Within the Data Stream Processing paradigm, traditional database queries on static relations have been revised in order to operate on continuous data streams. Most of the past papers propose sequential algorithms for continuous skyline queries, whereas there exist very few works targeting implementations on parallel machines. This paper contributes to fill this gap by proposing a parallel implementation for multicore architectures. We propose (i) a parallelization of the eager algorithm based on the notion of Skyline Influence Time, (ii) optimizations of the reduce phase and load-balancing strategies to achieve near-optimal speedup, and (iii) a set of experiments with both synthetic benchmarks and a real dataset in order to show our implementation effectiveness.

Indeed, the speed at which trades are executed and data transmitted is accelerating, and it is fair to say that algorithms are now the primary interacting agents operating in the financial markets. However, we contend that HFT is first and foremost a cultural phenomenon. More specifically, both individuals and collective agents \u2013 such as algorithms \u2013 might be considered cultural entities, charged with very different ways of processing information, making sense of it and turning it into knowledge and practice.

The proposed DNB allows simultaneously to represent expert knowledge of skilled traders in a model structure and to learn computationally from data information that reflects relevant market sentiment dynamics. The DBN is derived from a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) that incorporates expert knowledge in its design and learns the trend patterns present in the market data. The wavelet representation is used to produce compact representations of the LOB liquidity dynamics that simultaneously reduces the time complexity of the computational learning and improves its precision. In previous works, this trading strategy has been shown to be competitive when compared with conventional techniques. However, these works failed to control for unwanted dependencies in the return series used for training and testing that may have skewed performance results to the positive side. This paper constructs key trading strategy estimators based on the Random Entry Protocol over the USD-COP data. This technique eliminates unwanted dependencies on returns and order flow while keeps the natural autocorrelation structure of the LimitOrder Book (LOB). It is still concluded that the HHMM-based model results are competitive with a positive, statistically significant P\/L and a well-understood risk profile.

Based on high-frequency volatility, cumulative trading volumes, trade counts and market depth of various stocks traded at the NYSE, we show that the proposed transformation is supported by the data and allows capturing (multivariate) dynamics in higher order moments. The latter are modeled using a DCC-GARCH specification. We suggest estimating the model by composite maximum likelihood which is sufficiently flexible to be applicable in high dimensions. Strong empirical evidence for time-varying conditional (co-)variances in trading processes supports the usefulness of the approach. Taking these higher-order dynamics explicitly into account significantly improves the goodness-of-fit and out-of-sample forecasts of the multiplicative error model. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"DCC-GARCH; Gaussian domain; Liquidity risk; Multiplicative error model; Trading processes"}

The establishment of a national market system and Regulation NMS was meant to promote competition, recognizing the evolution and changing dynamics introduced by technological innovation. This evolution and governing rule set has had many positive effects in terms of competition, fee compression, tighter spread potential and volumes. Our paper identifies certain unintended consequences and complexities of the national market system including fragmentation, sub second quoting and trading, complex order types, data asymmetry, technological innovation, unique strategies and the algorithms that power them. When acting in concert, these complexities give rise to opportunities as well as emerging risks. This high-speed system can be unstable and susceptible to inherent conflicts of interest, market abuse and price shocks. These shocks can be amplified by positive feedback loops accelerating single stock declines and also posing systemic risks in time scales beyond real-time physical human comprehension and reaction times. Furthermore they can produce contagion, which we refer to as 'Flash Splashes' caused by rapid withdrawals and injections of liquidity in increasingly linked asset classes, indices, sectors and global liquidity pools. High frequency trading strategies can be both passive and aggressive and usually display risk averse and low inventory characteristics. These strategies leverage fragmentation as they create or capture informational asymmetries. They interact directly with sell side algorithms that can hide intentions, hunt liquidity and sweep the order book. These interactions create market dynamics that can benefit and challenge anyone exposed to US equity markets. Every market participant has a risk profile unique to their strategy and objective and while regulations will be enriched or revised and certain unfair practices eliminated great attention should be paid to understanding modern high speed trading risks and both the positive and negative impacts on all stakeholders.

This study aims to provide a baseline understanding of the effect of HFT on markets by using a paradigm of zero-intelligence traders and examining the resulting structural changes. Design\/methodology\/approach-A continuous double auction setting with zero-intelligence traders is used by adapting the model of Gode and Sunder (1993) to include algorithmic high frequency (HF) traders who retrade by marking up their shares by a fixed percentage. The simulation examines the effects of two independent factors, the number of HF traders and their markup percentage, on several dependent variables, principally volume, market efficiency, trader surplus and volatility. Results of the simulations are tested with two-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc tests. Findings-In the simulation results, trading volume, efficiency and total surplus vary directly with the number of traders employing HFT. Results also reveal that market volatility increased with the number of HF traders. Research limitations\/implications-Increases in volume, efficiency and total surplus represent market improvements due to the trading activities of HF traders. However, the increase in volatility is worrisome, and some of the surplus increase appears to come at the expense of long-term-oriented investors. However, the relatively recent development of HFT and dearth of appropriate data make direct calibration of any model difficult.

It shows that securities markets are dominated by a cohort of \"structural insiders,\" namely a set of traders able to utilize close physical and informational access to trade at speeds measured in milliseconds and microseconds, a practice loosely termed high frequency trading (HFT). By virtue of speed and physical proximity to exchanges, these HFT traders can systematically gain frst access to new information, trade on it, and change prices before the rest of the market can see its content. This Article makes three contributions. First, it introduces and develops the concept of structural insider trading. Securities markets increasingly rely on automated traders utilizing algorithms- or pre-programmed electronic instructions-for trading. Policy allows traders to enjoy important structural advantages: (i) to physically locate on or next to an exchange, shortening the time it takes for information to travel to and from the marketplace; and (ii) to receive feeds of richly detailed data directly to these co-located trading operations. With algorithms sophisticated enough to respond instantly and independently to new information, co-located automated traders can receive and trade on not-fully-public information ahead of other investors. Indeed, by the time that the rest of the market sees this information, it has long since become out-of-date. Secondly, this Article shows that structural insider trading exhibits harms that are substantially similar to those regulated under conventional theories of corporate insider trading. Structural insiders place other investors at a persistent informational disadvantage. Through their frst sight of marketmoving data, structural insiders can capture the best trades and Erode the profts of informed traders, reducing their incentives to participate in the marketplace. Despite the similarity in harms, however, this Article shows that current doctrine does not apply to restrict structural insider trading. Rather, structural insiders thrive in full public view, and with regulatory permission. Thirdly, this Article explores the implications of structural insider trading for the theory and doctrine of insider trading. It shows them to be increasingly incoherent in their application. In protecting investors against one set of insiders but not another, law and policy appear under profound strain in the face of innovative markets.","Author Keywords":null}

Our control strategies are designed to address latency constraints, using Queueing Theory models, and energy consumption by changing the number of used cores and the CPU frequency through the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) support available in the modern multicore CPUs. The proactive capabilities, in addition to the latency-and energy-awareness, represent the novel features of our approach. To validate our methodology, we develop a thorough set of experiments on a high-frequency trading application.

We employ a simple model of latency arbitrage in which a single security is traded on two exchanges, with price quotes available to regular traders only after some delay. An infinitely fast arbitrageur reaps profits when the two markets diverge due to this latency in cross-market communication. Using an agent-based approach, we simulate interactions between high-frequency and zero-intelligence trading agents. From simulation data over a large space of strategy combinations, we estimate game models and compute strategic equilibria in a variety of market environments. We then evaluate allocative efficiency and market liquidity in equilibrium, and we find that market fragmentation and the presence of a latency arbitrageur reduces total surplus and negatively impacts liquidity. By replacing continuous-time markets with periodic call markets, we eliminate latency arbitrage opportunities and achieve further efficiency gains through the aggregation of orders over short time periods. \u00a9 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.","Author Keywords":"Agent-based simulation; High-frequency trading; Latency arbitrage"}

The focus of the paper is on the relation between imitation and ignorance within the organizational structure of high-frequency trading (HFT) firms. In social studies of finance (SSF) literature imitation is considered a strategic act, i.e. imitation is a term applied when traders copy the strategies of other traders. I wish to turn this relation between ignorance and imitation on its head and consider ignorance itself as a strategic unknown and investigate the kinds of imitations that might be produced from structures of not-knowing (i.e. structures intended to divide, obscure and protect knowledge). This point is illustrated through ethnographic studies and interviews within five HFT firms. The data show how a black-box structure of ignorance is replicated within the organizational setting of these firms and re-enacted by the traders. Towards the end of the paper the politics of the relationship between imitation and ignorance is discussed. \u00a9 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"black box; high-frequency trading; ignorance; imitation; organizational structure; social studies of finance"}

The main objective of this research is to check three different statistical arbitrage strategies using high frequency trading with 14 OMX Baltic market stocks and measure their efficiency and risks. One strategy used in this paper was first implemented by M.S Perlini, the other one by J.F. Caldeira and G.V. Moura and the last one was presented by D. Herlemont.

An important theory in financial markets is mean reversion, which plays a critical role in some state-of-the-art portfolio selection strategies. Although existing mean reversion strategies have been shown to achieve good empirical performance on certain datasets, they seldom carefully deal with noise and outliers in the data, leading to suboptimal portfolios, and consequently yielding poor performance in practice. In this paper, we propose to exploit the reversion phenomenon by using robust L 1 -median estimators, and design a novel online portfolio selection strategy named 'Robust Median Reversion' (RMR), which constructs optimal portfolios based on the improved reversion estimator. We examine the performance of the proposed algorithms on various real markets with extensive experiments. Empirical results show that RMR can overcome the drawbacks of existing mean reversion algorithms and achieve significantly better results. Finally, RMR runs in linear time, and thus is suitable for large-scale real-time algorithmic trading applications. \u00a9 1989-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"L 1 -median; mean reversion; online learning; Portfolio selection; robust median reversion"}

Data visualizations have proven to be a fundamental tool for building intuition and enabling exploratory data analysis in many fields. In this paper, we propose the incorporation of visualizations in the workflow of multiple financial regulatory roles, including market surveillance, enforcement and supporting academic research. \u00a9 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).","Author Keywords":"Exploratory visual analytics; Financial data visualization; Limit order book"}

This paper focuses on the most ambitious regulation directed at the practice: the algorithm-tagging rule in the German High-Frequency Trading Act. Fifteen interviews with stakeholders in the Act\u2019s implementation serve to reconstruct how regulators defined an algorithm and help pose the question of to what extent regulatory definitions and data need accurately to represent financial practices to be useful. Although tentative in its findings, the research suggests that the algorithm-tagging rule may be providing valuable signals in the noise to trade surveillance officers and having virtuous effects on the cultures of trading firms. The conclusion argues that sociologists of finance should adopt a more balanced approach when evaluating regulatory technologies and heed MacKenzie\u2019s 2005 call to open up their black boxes. \u00a9 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"algorithms; compliance; enforcement; financial regulation; high-frequency trading"}

However, an often overlooked definite advantage of wireless links over fiber-optic links is that waves travel at the speed of light c, which is about 50% faster than in optical fibers as shown in Fig. 17.9.1 (top left). This 'minimum latency' is crucial for applications requiring real-time responses over a long distance, including high-frequency trading [1]. Further opportunities and new applications might be created if the absolute minimum latency and fiber-optic data-rates are put together. (Sub-)THz frequencies have an extremely broad atmospheric transmission window with manageable losses as shown in Fig. 17.9.1 (top right) and will be ideal for building light-speed links supporting fiber-optic data-rates.

The approach is based on a meta-grammatical evolution methodology that combines technical, fundamental and macroeconomic analysis on a hybrid top-down paradigm. First, the method provides a low-risk portfolio by analyzing countries and industries. Next, aiming to focus on the most robust companies, the system filters the portfolio by analyzing their economic variables. Finally, the system analyzes prices and volumes to optimize investment decisions during a given period. System validation involves a series of experiments in the European financial markets, which are reflected with a data set of over nine hundred companies. The final solutions have been compared with static strategies and other evolutionary implementations and the results show the effectiveness of the proposal. \u00a9 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Author Keywords":"Automated trading systems; Fundamental analysis; Grammatical evolution; Macroeconomic analysis; Meta-GE; Technical analysis"}

In this paper we discuss the challenges facedby HFT systems and the opportunity for big data processingwith low latency in the field. Most HFT systems are designedusing real time stream processing, which have certaindrawbacks.

To be able to design efficient and effective automated trading strategies, one first needs to understand the workings of the market, the strategies that traders use, and their interactions as well as the patterns emerging as a result of these interactions. In this article, we develop an agent-based model of the foreign exchange (FX) market, which is the market for the buying and selling of currencies. Our agent-based model of the FX market comprises heterogeneous trading agents that employ a strategy that identifies and responds to periodic patterns in the price time series. We use the agent-based model of the FX market to undertake a systematic exploration of its constituent elements and their impact on the stylized facts (statistical patterns) of transactions data. This enables us to identify a set of sufficient conditions that result in the emergence of the stylized facts similarly to the real market data, and formulate a model that closely approximates the stylized facts. We use a unique high-frequency data set of historical transactions data that enables us to run multiple simulation runs and validate our approach and draw comparisons and conclusions for each market setting. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Author Keywords":"agent-based modeling; agent-based simulation; electronic markets; FX markets; stylized facts"}

Stream processing is one of the potential application scenarios of big data systems where the goal is to process a continuous, high velocity flow of information items. High frequency trading (HFT) in stock markets or trending topic detection in Twitter are some examples of stream processing applications. In some cases (like, for instance, in HFT), these applications have end-to-end quality-of-service requirements and may benefit from the usage of real-time techniques. Taking this into account, the present article analyzes, from the point of view of real-time systems, a set of patterns that can be used when implementing a stream processing application. For each pattern, we discuss its advantages and disadvantages, as well as its impact in application performance, measured as response time, maximum input frequency and changes in utilization demands due to the pattern. \u00a9 1990-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"big data; Real-time patterns; stream processing"}

Elasticity is the term coined to describe the capability of applications to change dynamically their resource usage in response to workload fluctuations. This paper focuses on strategies for elastic data stream processing targeting multicore systems. The key idea is to exploit Model Predictive Control, a control-theoretic method that takes into account the system behavior over a future time horizon in order to decide the best reconfiguration to execute. We design a set of energy-aware proactive strategies, optimized for throughput and latency QoS requirements, which regulate the number of used cores and the CPU frequency through the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) support offered by modern multicore CPUs. We evaluate our strategies in a high-frequency trading application fed by synthetic and real-world workload traces. We introduce specific properties to effectively compare different elastic approaches, and the results show that our strategies are able to achieve the best outcome. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Author Keywords":"Data stream processing; Elasticity; Frequency scaling; Model predictive control"}

QHawkes models generalize the Hawkes price models introduced in Bacry and Muzy [Quant. Finance, 2014, 14(7), 1147\u20131166], by allowing feedback effects in the jump intensity that are linear and quadratic in past returns. Our model exhibits two main properties that we believe are crucial in the modelling and the understanding of the volatility process: first, the model is time-reversal asymmetric, similar to financial markets whose time evolution has a preferred direction. Second, it generates a multiplicative, fat-tailed volatility process, that we characterize in detail in the case of exponentially decaying kernels, and which is linked to Pearson diffusions in the continuous limit. Several other interesting properties of QHawkes processes are discussed, in particular the fact that they can generate long memory without necessarily being at the critical point. A non-parametric fit of the QHawkes model on NYSE stock data shows that the off-diagonal component of the quadratic kernel indeed has a structure that standard Hawkes models fail to reproduce. We provide numerical simulations of our calibrated QHawkes model which is indeed seen to reproduce, with only a small amount of quadratic non-linearity, the correct magnitude of fat-tails and time reversal asymmetry seen in empirical time series. \u00a9 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"Financial prices; Hawkes processes; High-frequency trading; Market microstructure; Pearsons diffusion; Time-reversal asymmetry; Volatility modelling"}

It first relates the history of mathematics to the history of financial technologies, and argues, inspired by Simmel and Marcuse, that from ancient times to now there seems to be an evolution towards increasing quantification not only in finance, accounting etc., but in modern society in general. It shows that scientific and technological changes have social and ethical consequences, as quantification creates more distance between people. The paper then analyzes and discusses current shifts of financial agency that exemplify what seems to be a moment of hyper-quantification through the use of ICTs: experiences of \u201cthe market\u201d as an independent agent and money machines as artificial agents in high frequency trading\u2014perhaps the only agents still able to cope with the data-loaded and hyper-quantified world we live in. Under these conditions it becomes more difficult to exercise responsibility. The paper concludes that while we must acknowledge the human character of finance and mathematics, there are real human and social consequences of quantification, in ancient times and today, for society and responsibility. It is therefore misleading to assume that financial technologies and mathematics are ethically neutral; more analysis of ethical and societal aspects is needed, also from an \u201coutside\u201d perspective. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Author Keywords":"Artificial agents; Distance; Ethics of finance; Marcuse; Mathematics; Phenomenology; Philosophy of finance; Philosophy of technology and media; Quantification; Responsibility; Simmel; Sociology of finance"}

While the recent advance of portfolio selection in HFT market generates more profit, it yields much contended OLTP workloads. Featuring in exploiting the abundant parallelism, transaction pipeline, the state-of-the-art concurrency control (CC) mechanism, however suffers from limited concurrency confronted with HFT workloads. Its variants that enable more parallel execution by leveraging find-grained contention information also take little effect. To solve this problem, we for the first time observe and formulate the source of restricted concurrency as harmful ordering of transaction statements. To resolve harmful ordering, we propose PARE, a pipeline-aware reordered execution, to improve application performance by rearranging statements in order of their degrees of contention. In concrete, two mechanisms are devised to ensure the correctness of statement rearrangement and identify the degrees of contention of statements respectively. Experiment results show that PARE can improve transaction throughput and reduce transaction latency on HFT applications by upto an order of magnitude than the state-of-the-art CC mechanism. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Author Keywords":null}

Sequential quantile estimation is also known as online quantile estimation. This area is relevant to the analysis of data streams and to the one-pass analysis of massive data sets. Applications include network traffic and latency analysis, real time fraud detection and high frequency trading. We introduce new techniques for online quantile estimation based on Hermite series estimators in the settings of static quantile estimation and dynamic quantile estimation. In the static quantile estimation setting we apply the existing Gauss-Hermite expansion in a novel manner. In particular, we exploit the fact that Gauss-Hermite coefficients can be updated in a sequential manner. To treat dynamic quantile estimation we introduce a novel expansion with an exponentially weighted estimator for the Gauss-Hermite coefficients which we term the Exponentially Weighted Gauss-Hermite (EWGH) expansion. These algorithms go beyond existing sequential quantile estimation algorithms in that they allow arbitrary quantiles (as opposed to pre-specified quantiles) to be estimated at any point in time. In doing so we provide a solution to online distribution function and online quantile function estimation on data streams. In particular we derive an analytical expression for the CDF and prove consistency results for the CDF under certain conditions. In addition we analyse the associated quantile estimator. Simulation studies and tests on real data reveal the Gauss-Hermite based algorithms to be competitive with a leading existing algorithm. \u00a9 2017, Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

Following the \"Flash Crash\" of 2010 which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge 1000 points within minutes, high frequency trading has come under the radar of multi-jurisdictional regulators. Combining a review of the extant literature on high frequency trading with empirical data from interviews with financial traders, computer experts and regulators, we develop concepts of regulatory adaptation, technology asymmetry and market ambiguity to illustrate the 'dark art' of high frequency trading. Findings show high frequency trading is a multi-faceted, complex and secretive practice. It is implicated in market events, but correlation does not imply causation, as isolating causal mechanisms from interconnected automated financial trading is highly challenging for regulators who seek to monitor algorithmic trading across multiple jurisdictions.

Furthermore, we test whether the presence of HFT leads to the introduction of colocation services. The data are consistent with the view that HFT pre-dates colocation by at least eight months on most exchanges, and has strong power in explaining the introduction of colocation services. In effect, our results show that colocation services do not properly measure effective AT and HFT; rather, colocation services are the result of HFT. Exchanges choose to offer colocation services due to the fact HFT requires higher speed transactions. Finally, we show there have been substantial changes in trade size in other countries such as China where there is no HFT and offer explanations for these changes and suggest avenues for future research. \u00a9 2014 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"Colocation; High-frequency trading; International market microstructure; Trade size"}

And all this data and trading activity has impact among themselves, thus a tight relative timing between different sites in finance trading is mandatory. In the Finance sector the requirements of different actors may be different: transferring legal time from certified institutions to trading centers, time synchronization at a data center scale, deterministic timing for finely coordinated trading actions at a global scale, etc. Our contribution describes how to distribute deterministically a global notion of time across an optical fiber network to arrive at a tight relative timing (accurate time synchronization among the network elements). Another use case is related to low latency which is a highly demanded feature in specific segments (e.g. reduction in exchange latency improves market quality). Latency is a necessary condition for the implementation of various types of strategies and low latency automated trading is associated with lower quoted and effective spreads, lower volatility and greater liquidity. We describe how we can use latency control mechanisms for evaluating it in the framework of a service level agreement. In summary, actors in the Finance sector are adapting to the new situation, the millisecond (soon nanosecond) framework and we present an ultra-accurate solution for this target. \u00a9 2017 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.

In a networked world, we would like mobile devices to provide a crisp user experience and applications to instantaneously return results. Unfortunately, application performance does not depend solely on processing time, but also on a number of different components that are commonly counted in the overall system latency. Latency is more than just a nuisance to the user, poorly accounted-for, it degrades application performance. In fields such as high frequency trading, as well as in many data centers, latency translates easily to financial losses. Research to date has focused on specific contributions to latency: from improving latency within the network to latency control on the application level. This paper takes an holistic approach to latency, and aims to provide a break-down of end-to-end latency from the application level to the wire. Using a set of crafted experiments, we explore the many contributors to latency. We assert that more attention should be paid to the latency within the host, and show that there is no silver bullet to solve the end-to-end latency challenge in data centers. We believe that a better understanding of the key elements influencing data center latency can trigger a more focused research, improving the user\u2019s quality of experience. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Author Keywords":null}

In this paper the idea of mixed data sampling (MIDAS) is extended from linear correlation in Colacito et al. (2011) to the more general dependence measure: copula, and a copula-MIDAS model is proposed to describe the asymmetric return-liquidity dependence of CSI 300 index futures with short-run and long-run components. Based on the skewed t copula-MIDAS model, it is found that extreme decreases in returns tend to be accompanied by extreme increases in bid-ask spreads, but extreme increases in returns may not coincide with extreme reductions in bid-ask spreads. Furthermore, the return-spread dependence consists of both short-run and long-run components, and the long-run component will influence the return-spread dependence in the next two weeks. Last, the out-of-sample forecast of liquidity risk stresses the importance of considering asymmetry and long-run trend in return-spread dependence as it enables investors to well predict liquidity risk in times of market crashes. The results imply that high frequency trading investors of CSI 300 index futures should pay more attentions to prevent the potential liquidity risk when the bid-ask spreads are widened. And investors are suggested to use the past two-week high frequency data to forecast the current return-spread dependence in liquidity risk management. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Copula; CSI 300 index futures; Liquidity; Mixed data sampling; Return"}

The proposed PPT objective can be formulated as a fast backpropagation algorithm, which is suitable for large-scale and time-limited applications, such as high-frequency trading. Extensive experiments on several benchmark data sets from diverse real financial markets show that PPT outperforms other state-of-the-art systems in computational time, cumulative wealth, and risk-adjusted metrics. It suggests that PPT is effective and even more robust than some defensive systems in PS. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Aggressive strategy; linear learning system; peak price tracking (PPT); portfolio selection (PS)"}

In this paper, we primarily focus on accelerating stream joins, arguably one of the most commonly used and resource-intensive operators in stream processing. We propose a scalable circular pipeline design (Circular-MJ) in hardware to orchestrate multi-way join while minimizing data flow disruption. In this circular design, each new tuple (given its origin stream) starts its processing from a specific join core and passes through all respective join cores in a pipeline sequence to produce final results. We further present a novel two-stage pipeline stream join (Stashed-MJ) that uses a best-effort buffering technique (stash) to maintain intermediate results. In a case that an overwrite is detected in the stash, our design automatically resorts to recomputing intermediate results. Our experimental results demonstrate a linear throughput scaling with respect to the number of execution units in hardware. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"FPGA; Hardware acceleration; Heterogeneous hardware; Parallel algorithms; Query optimization; Stream Joins"}

In order to convert financial time series into 2-D images, 15 different technical indicators each with different parameter selections are utilized. Each indicator instance generates data for a 15 day period. As a result, 15 \u00d7 15 sized 2-D images are constructed. Each image is then labeled as Buy, Sell or Hold depending on the hills and valleys of the original time series.

This deficiency can be attributed to the lack of facetime between teachers and students, and amongst students themselves. In this article, we use the teaching and learning of economics as a case study to illustrate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) based robotic players to help engage students in online, asynchronous environments, therefore, potentially improving student learning outcomes. In particular, students could learn about competitive markets by joining a market full of automated trading robots who find every chance to arbitrage. Alternatively, students could learn to play against other humans by playing against robotic players trained to mimic human behavior, such as anticipating spiteful rejections to unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game where a proposer offers a particular way to split the pot that the responder can only accept or reject. By training robotic players with past data, possibly coming from different country and regions, students can experience and learn how players in different cultures might make decisions under the same scenario. AI can thus help online educators bridge the last mile, incorporating the benefit of both online and in-person learning. \u00a9 1973-2011 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"artificial intelligence; classroom experiments; games; Online education; robotic strategy"}

Construction of BSE was motivated by the fact that most of the world's major financial markets have automated, with trading activity that previously was the responsibility of human traders now being performed by high-speed autonomous automated trading systems. Research aimed at understanding the dynamics of this new style of financial market is hampered by the fact that no operational real-world financial exchange is ever likely to allow experimental probing of that market while it is open and running live, forcing researchers to work primarily from time-series of past trading data. Similarly, university-level education of the engineers who can create next-generation automated-trading systems requires that they have hands-on learning experiences in a sufficiently realistic teaching environment.

High levels of order flow toxicity can culminate in market makers providing liquidity at a loss or in the suboptimal execution of trades. From a regulatory perspective, high levels of toxicity can be harmful to overall market liquidity and precede precipitous drops in asset prices. The bulk volume-volume-synchronized probability of informed trading (BV-VPIN) model is one way of measuring the \u201ctoxicity\u201d component of order flow, and it has been successfully applied in high-frequency trading environments. We apply the BV-VPIN to daily data from a range of international indexes in order to extend previous analyses of its properties.We find that a rise in BV-VPIN effectively foreshadows high levels of volatility in the equity indexes of several countries. If a BV-VPIN futures contract were to exist, we show that it would exhibit safe haven characteristics during market downturns. In particular, a simple active portfolio management strategy that times investments in equities (risk-free assets) when BV-VPIN levels are low (high) outperforms a buy-and-hold strategy. Thus, we find support for the application of BV-VPIN in international equity markets as a risk monitoring and management tool for portfolio managers and regulators. \u00a9 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","Author Keywords":"Bulk volume classification; International equities; Liquidity; Order flow toxicity; VPIN"}

Newly, the concept drift is considered as a challenging data imbalance that should be ignored by the NDMs, and only system changes and outliers represent novelty. The field of application for such NDMs is broad. For example, the method can be used as a supportive method for real-time system fault detection, for onset detection of events in biomedical signals, in monitoring of nonlinearly controlled processes, for event driven automated trading, etc. The two newly studied methods are the error and learning based novelty detection (ELBND) and the learning entropy (LE) based detection. These methods use both the error and weight increments of a (supervised) learning model. Here, we study these methods with normalized least-mean squares (NLMS) adaptive filter, and while the NDMs were studied on various real life tasks, newly, we carry out the study on two types of data streams with concept drift to analyze the general ability for unsupervised novelty detection. The two data streams, one with system changes, second with outliers, represent different novelty scenarios to demonstrate the performance of the proposed NDMs with concept drifts in data. Both tested NDMs work as a feature extractor. Thus, a classification framework is used for the evaluation of the obtained features and NDM benchmarking, where two other NDMs, one based on the adaptive model plain error, second using the sample entropy (SE), are used as the reference for the comparison to the proposed methods. The results show that both newly studied NDMs are superior to the merely use of the plain error of adaptive model and also to the sample entropy based detection while they are robust against the concept drift occurrence. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Adaptive filter; Concept drift; Learning algorithms; Novelty detection; Outlier detection; Streaming data; System change"}

When analyzing ten types of recent (up to April 2018) extremely high-dimensional time series from automated trading domains, it was discovered that there is no a priori 'optimal' length of training history that would fit all investment tasks. The optimal history length depends of the specificity of the data and varies with time. This statement was also confirmed by the analysis of dozens of multi-dimensional synthetic time series data generated by excitable medium models frequently considered in studies of chaos. An algorithm for determining the optimal length of training history to produce a sustainable portfolio is proposed. Monitoring the size of the learning data can be useful in data mining tasks used in the analysis of sustainability in other research disciplines. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Automated trading; Length of training data; Sustainable portfolio"}

Our assessment updated the findings of previous research by including more recent data and adding South Africa, the latest member included in BRICS. Our results showed that the returns obtained by the automated system, on average, exceeded the value invested. There were groups of assets from each country that performed well above the portfolio average, surpassing the returns obtained using a buy and hold strategy.

NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has referred to such fast data feeds as \u201cInsider Trading 2.0\u201d. For example, Thomson Reuters sold the University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index to computerized trading firms 2\u00a0seconds before releasing its data to its other paying clients. This paper explores the ethical issues involved in the sale of such information. Is selling faster access ethically the same as traditional insider trading, which generally involves a breach of fiduciary duty or the use of misappropriated information? Such practices are extremely different from traditional insider trading as there is neither a breach of fiduciary duty nor misappropriation of inside information. The ethical issues are similar to other market segmentation and price discrimination issues, in which different prices are charged to different customers. The ability to price discriminate across segments can actually benefit large segments of the population who may receive lower prices because others, such as the high-speed traders, are paying more. The sale of faster access to information, especially by exchanges, raises additional ethical issues. There may be adverse effects on market quality that must be addressed.

This fact favours using an automated trading system for portfolio management. In this work, we propose an automated trading system using multiagent systems. We use fundamental and cluster analysis to select the stocks, and additionally we employ a financial distress prediction model to estimate companies financial health. We also optimize the portfolio for different investor's utility functions. Comparing our approach's results to a benchmark, we have obtained higher return values and lower risks; moreover, the approach was profitable even when we have added brokerage fees. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"automated trading system; cluster analysis; multiagent systems; portfolio management; portfolio optimization"}

Our paper uses recent high-frequency data (HFD) and investigates price comovements in the context of normal times and crisis periods. To this end, we applied a non-Gaussian Asymmetrical Dynamic Conditional Correlation (ADCC)-GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) model and the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) approach. This choice has three advantages: (i) With the development of high-frequency trading (HFT), it is more appropriate to use HFD to test price linkages for overlapping and nonoverlapping data. (ii) The ADCC-GARCH model captures further asymmetry in price comovements. (iii) The use of the MES enables to measure systemic risk contributions around the distribution tails. Accordingly, we offer two interesting findings. First, while the hypothesis of asymmetrical and time-varying stock return linkages is not rejected, the MES approach indicates that both European and US indices make a considerable contribution to each other's systemic risk, with significant input from Frankfurt to the French and US markets, especially following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Second, we show that the propagation of systemic risk is higher during the crisis period and overlapping trading hours than during nonoverlapping hours. Thus, the MES test is recommended as an indicator to help monitor market exposure to systemic risk and to gauge expected losses for other markets.

It covers changes in market design, electronic trading, and investor and trader behaviors. The emergence of high frequency trading and critical events like the\"Flash Crash\" of 2010 are also analyzed in depth. Using a quantitative viewpoint, this book explains how an attrition of liquidity and regulatory changes can impact the whole microstructure of financial markets. A mathematical Appendix details the quantitative tools and indicators used through the book, allowing the reader to go further independently. This book is written by practitioners and theoretical experts and covers practical aspects (like the optimal infrastructure needed to trade electronically in modern markets) and abstract analyses (like the use on entropy measurements to understand the progress of market fragmentation). As market microstructure is a recent academic field, students will benefit from the book's overview of the current state of microstructure and will use the Appendix to understand important methodologies. Policy makers and regulators will use this book to access theoretical analyses on real cases. For readers who are practitioners, this book delivers data analysis and basic processes like the designs of Smart Order Routing and trade scheduling algorithms. In this second edition, the authors have added a large section on orderbook dynamics, showing how liquidity can predict future price moves, and how High Frequency Traders can profit from it. The section on market impact has also been updated to show how buying or selling pressure moves prices not only for a few hours, but even for days, and how prices relax (or not) after a period of intense pressure. Further, this edition includes pages on Dark Pools, Circuit Breakers and added information outside of Equity Trading, because MiFID 2 is likely to push fixed income markets towards more electronification. The authors explore what is to be expected from this change in microstructure. The appendix has also been augmented to include the propagator models (for intraday price impact), a simple version of Kyle's model (1985) for daily market impact, and a more sophisticated optimal trading framework, to support the design of trading algorithms. \u00a9 2018 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Calendar spread option volume has been low and a more precise model to price them could lead to lower bid-ask spreads as well as more accurate marking to market of open positions. Design\/methodology\/approach: The new option pricing model is a two-factor model with the futures price and the convenience yield as the two factors. The key assumption is that convenience follows arithmetic Brownian motion. The new model and alternative models are tested using corn futures prices. The testing considers both the accuracy of distributional assumptions and the accuracy of the models\u2019 predictions of historical payoffs. Findings: Panel unit root tests fail to reject the unit root null hypothesis for historical calendar spreads and thus they support the assumption of convenience yield following arithmetic Brownian motion. Option payoffs are estimated with five different models and the relative performance of the models is determined using bias and root mean squared error. The new model outperforms the four other models; most of the other models overestimate actual payoffs. Research limitations\/implications: The model is parameterized using historical data due to data limitations although future research could consider implied parameters. The model assumes that storage costs are constant and so it cannot separate between negative convenience yield and mismeasured storage costs. Practical implications: The over 30-year search for a calendar spread pricing model has not produced a satisfactory model. Current models that do not assume cointegration will overprice calendar spread options. The model used by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for marking to market of open positions is shown to work poorly. The model proposed here could be used as a basis for automated trading on calendar spread options as well as marking to market of open positions. Originality\/value: The model is new. The empirical work supports both the model\u2019s assumptions and its predictions as being more accurate than competing models. \u00a9 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Author Keywords":"Calendar spreads; Corn; Futures; Options; Panel unit root tests"}

However, arising from the SIMD execution model, the branch divergence issue lowers efciency of conditional branching on GPUs, and hinders the development of GPGPU. To achieve runtime on-the-spot branch divergence reduction, we propose the frst on-GPU thread-data remapping scheme. Before kernel launching, our solution inserts codes into GPU kernels immediately before each target branch so as to acquire actual runtime divergence information. GPU software threads can be remapped to datasets multiple times during single kernel execution. We propose two thread-data remapping algorithms that are tailored to the GPU architecture. Effective on two generations of GPUs from both NVIDIA and AMD, our solution achieves speedups up to 2.718 with third-party benchmarks. We also implement three GPGPU frontier benchmarks from areas including computer vision, algorithmic trading and data analytics. They are hindered by more complex divergence coupled with different memory access patterns, and our solution works better than the traditional thread-data remapping scheme in all cases. As a compiler-assisted runtime solution, it can better reduce divergence for divergent applications that gain little acceleration on GPUs for the time being. \u00a9 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Author Keywords":"Branch divergence; GPGPU; Parallel computing; SIMD"}

However, there are only very few works considering the stability of the EFSs, and these studies were limited to certain types of membership functions with specifically predefined parameters, which largely increases the complexity of the learning process. At the same time, stability analysis is of paramount importance for control applications and provides the theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the learning algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the stability proof of a class of EFSs based on data clouds, which are grounded at the AnYa type fuzzy systems and the recently introduced empirical data analytics (EDA) methodological framework. By employing data clouds, the class of EFSs of AnYa type considered in this paper avoids the traditional way of defining membership functions for each input variable in an explicit manner and its learning process is entirely data driven. The stability of the considered EFS of AnYa type is proven through the Lyapunov theory, and the proof of stability shows that the average identification error converges to a small neighborhood of zero. Although, the stability proof presented in this paper is specially elaborated for the considered EFS, it is also applicable to general EFSs. The proposed method is illustrated with Box-Jenkins gas furnace problem, one nonlinear system identification problem, Mackey-Glass time series prediction problem, eight real-world benchmark regression problems as well as a high-frequency trading prediction problem. Compared with other EFSs, the numerical examples show that the considered EFS in this paper provides guaranteed stability as well as a better approximation accuracy. \u00a9 1993-2012 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"AnYa type fuzzy systems; data clouds; evolving fuzzy systems (EFSs); stability"}

According to the DC concept, data is sampled only when the magnitude of price change is significant according to the investor. In this paper, we develop a contrarian trading strategy named TSFDC. TSFDC is based on a forecasting model which aims to predict the change of the direction of market's trend under the DC context. We examine the profitability, risk and risk-adjusted return of TSFDC in the FX market using eight currency pairs. The results suggest that TSFDC outperforms the buy and hold approach and another DC-based trading strategy.

This is a major issue, as trading speed overwhelming the capability of the server to cope with the incoming orders might jeopardise the orderly functioning of the markets. It will be shown how, by raising the speed of trading and increasing the number of the agents operating in the market, it is possible to generate a crisis, no matter how performing the exchange server is. The paper presents a theoretical framework and then verifies its occurrence by analysing audit trail data. The theoretical framework shows a scenario in which under certain, heavy but by no means uncommon, conditions, the excess speed of the trading agents with respect to servers is capable of exacerbating price volatility, leading to vicious feedback loops capable of potentially creating a financial crisis. The empirical part analyses data taken from a particularly volatile day and compares them with much less volatile days. It results that, because of excessive speed, one of the most widely used techniques for minimising risk, order churning, can cause a major crisis. \u00a9 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

More investors put their effort to the development of a systematic approach, i.e., the so called \"Trading System (TS)\" for stocks pricing and trend prediction. The introduction of the Trading On-Line (TOL) has significantly improved the overall number of daily transactions on the stock market with the consequent increasing of the market complexity and liquidity. One of the most main consequence of the TOL is the \"automatic trading\", i.e., an ad-hoc algorithmic robot able to automatically analyze a lot of financial data with target to open\/close several trading operations in such reduced time for increasing the profitability of the trading system. When the number of such automatic operations increase significantly, the trading approach is known as High Frequency Trading (HFT). In this context, recently, the usage of machine learning has improved the robustness of the trading systems including HFT sector. The authors propose an innovative approach based on usage of ad-hoc machine learning approach, starting from historical data analysis, is able to perform careful stock price prediction. The stock price prediction accuracy is further improved by using adaptive correction based on the hypothesis that stock price formation is regulated by Markov stochastic propriety. The validation results applied to such shares and financial instruments confirms the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed automatic trading algorithm. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"LSTM; Machine learning; Stock price"}

The price of these currencies changes rapidly. However, we need to have a good trading strategy to take advantage of these variations. As Forex is a dynamic market, it becomes more difficult to control trading behavior and it becomes very complex to predict the events that can occur. Due to the chaotic, noisy, and nonstationary nature of the data, many algorithmic approaches were adopted in the aim to help traders and make FOREX speculation successful. Algorithmic trading offers the ability to have a strategy in advance. It helps traders to take the final decision. When the decision is so wide and complex, that one algorithm cannot possess all rules to take it. It becomes necessary to call upon several agents, who must work together in pursuing a common objective. These agents co-operate with one another to solve these decision problems. Coordinating between agents in a multi-agent system gives more flexibility and performance to problem solving. Each agent simultaneous results are combined by using a super-agent who helps to make the final decision. In our paper, we propose a theoretical Multi Agent System for stock market Speculation. We use four agents working in one system. The first one is a Metaheuristic Algorithm agent, the second one is based on technical indicators, the third one is a Text Mining agent, and the fourth one is a Fundamental Factor agent. The final decision should be made based on the combination of the four agents results. We think that working with Metaheuristics can improve speculation results compared to the use of classical algorithms. In perspective work, we test our system on a multiagent systems platform. \u00a9 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Author Keywords":"Fundamental factor; Metaheuristic; Multi agent system; Particle swarm optimization; Smart agent; Speculation; Stock market; Technical indicators; Text mining"}

The agents negotiate with one another to reach the best agreement for the users they represent.

The purpose of this work is to develop an agent that will be able to negotiate given partial information about the user\u2019s preferences. First, we present a new partial information model that is supplied to the agent, which is based on categorical data in the form of pairwise comparisons of outcomes instead of precise utility information. Using this partial information, we develop an estimation model that uses linear optimization and translates the information into utility estimates. We test our methods in a negotiation scenario based on a smart grid cooperative where agents participate in energy trade-offs. The results show that already with very limited information the model becomes accurate quickly and performs well in an actual negotiation setting. Our work provides valuable insight into how uncertainty affects an agent\u2019s negotiation performance, how much information is needed to be able to formulate an accurate user model, and shows a capability of negotiating effectively with minimal user feedback. \u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Author Keywords":null}

Successful real human traders, and advanced automated algorithmic trading systems, learn from experience and adapt over time as market conditions change; our DLNN learns to copy this adaptive trading behavior. A novel aspect of our work is that we do not involve the conventional approach of attempting to predict time-series of prices of tradeable securities. Instead, we collect large volumes of training data by observing only the quotes issued by a successful sales-trader in the market, details of the orders that trader is executing, and the data available on the LOB (as would usually be provided by a centralized exchange) over the period that the trader is active. In this paper we demonstrate that suitably configured DLNNs can learn to replicate the trading behavior of a successful adaptive automated trader, an algorithmic system previously demonstrated to outperform human traders. We also demonstrate that DLNNs can learn to perform better (i.e., more profitably) than the trader that provided the training data. We believe that this is the first ever demonstration that DLNNs can successfully replicate a human-like, or super-human, adaptive trader operating in a realistic emulation of a real-world financial market. Our results can be considered as proof-of-concept that a DLNN could, in principle, observe the actions of a human trader in a real financial market and over time learn to trade equally as well as that human trader, and possibly better. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Automated Trading; Deep Learning; Financial Engineering; Financial Markets; Intelligent Agents"}

Using order-level data from the National Stock Exchange of India, we find that proprietary algorithmic traders increase limit order supply following periods of both high short-term stock-specific volatility and extreme stock price movement. Even following periods of high marketwide volatility, they do not decrease their supply of liquidity. We define orders from high-frequency traders as a subclass of orders from proprietary algorithmic traders that are revised in less than three milliseconds. The behavior of high-frequency trading mimics the behavior of its parent class. This is inconsistent with the theory that fast traders leave the market when stress situations arise, although their limit-order-supplying behavior becomes weaker when the increase in short-term volatility is more informational than transitory. Agency algorithmic traders and nonalgorithmic traders behave opposite to proprietary algorithmic traders by reducing the supply of liquidity during stress situations. The presence of faster traders in the market possibly instills the fear of adverse selection in them. We document that the order imbalance of agency algorithmic traders is positively related to future short-term returns, whereas the order imbalance of proprietary algorithmic traders is negatively related to future short-term returns. \u00a9 2018 Financial Management Association International","Author Keywords":null}

There are various strategies for investment, ranging from the buy-and-hold strategy that let time makes money to high-frequency trading based on complicated models of machine learning. For the general public, the candlestick analysis is a simple and straightforward way to predict the market trend and help make decisions on buy and sell. However, the general effectiveness and validity of such methodology are understudied, and many previous guidebooks on candlestick analysis were based on specific cases and the summary of prior experiences, but lack unbiased and rigorous confirmation. Here, we aim at evaluating the effectiveness of multiple famous candlestick patterns based on recent data of 20 U.S. stocks. By estimating the fraction of correct guesses and expected return, we were able to show that three of the four patterns under scrutiny were not effective in generating profitable outcomes, but one of them do provide valuable information on market trend reversal. Although testing more candlestick patterns and using more test data may lead to the discoveries of more patterns being significantly profitable, our results call for scrutiny and scientific guidance for the general public when applying the candlestick analysis, and questions the general validity and applicability of such analyses. \u00a9 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Author Keywords":"Candlestick; Stock price; Technical analysis; Trading strategy"}

Two recent publications employed support vector machines and second-order Factorization Machines, respectively, to this end. However, these approaches either completely neglect interactions between the features extracted from the text, or they only account for second-order interactions. In this paper, we apply higher-order Factorization Machines, for which efficient training algorithms have only been available since 2016. As Factorization Machines require hyperparameters to be specified, we also introduce a novel adaptive-order algorithm for automatically determining them. Our study is the first one to make use of social media data for predicting minute-by-minute stock returns, namely the ones of the S&P 500 stock constituents. We show that, unlike a trading strategy employing support vector machines, Factorization-Machine-based strategies attain positive returns after transactions costs for the years 2014 and 2015. Especially the approach applying the adaptive-order algorithm outperforms classical approaches with respect to a multitude of criteria, and it features very favorable characteristics. \u00a9 2018, \u00a9 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"Factorization Machine; Finance; High-frequency trading; Machine learning; Social media; Statistical arbitrage"}

So far, there have been very limited attempts for extracting relevant features based on the limit order book data. In this paper, we address this problem by designing a new set of handcrafted features and performing an extensive experimental evaluation on both liquid and illiquid stocks. More specifically, we present an extensive set of econometric features that capture the statistical properties of the underlying securities for the task of mid-price prediction. The experimental evaluation consists of a head-to-head comparison with other handcrafted features from the literature and with features extracted from a long short-term memory autoencoder by means of a fully automated process. Moreover, we develop a new experimental protocol for online learning that treats the task above as a multi-objective optimization problem and predicts: 1) the direction of the next price movement and; 2) the number of order book events that occur until the change takes place. In order to predict the mid-price movement, features are fed into nine different deep learning models based on multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and long short-term memory neural networks. The performance of the proposed method is then evaluated on liquid and illiquid stocks (i.e., TotalView-ITCH US and Nordic stocks). For some stocks, results suggest that the correct choice of a feature set and a model can lead to the successful prediction of how long it takes to have a stock price movement. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Deep learning; econometrics; high-frequency trading; limit order book; mid-price; U.S. data"}

We develop an artificial futures market populated with high-frequency traders (HFTs) and institutional traders using Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP) trading algorithm. We simulate real-life futures trading at the millisecond time frame by applying STGP to E-Mini S&P 500 data stamped at the millisecond interval. A direct forecasting comparison between HFTs and institutional traders indicate the superiority of the former. We observe that the negative implications of high-frequency trading in futures markets can be mitigated by introducing a minimum resting trading period of less than 50 milliseconds. Overall, we contribute to the e-commerce literature by showing that minimum resting trading order period of less than 50 milliseconds could lead to HFTs facing a queuing risk resulting in a less harmful market quality effect. One practical implication of our study is that we demonstrate that market regulators and\/or e-commerce practitioners can apply artificial intelligence tools such as STGP to conduct trading behavior-based profiling.

It turns out, however, that real data do not always support the genuine Poisson process. This has lead to variants and augmentations such as time dependent and varying intensities, for example. This paper investigates the fractional Poisson process. We introduce the process and elaborate its main characteristics. The exemplary application considered here is the Carm\u00e9r\u2013Lundberg theory and the Sparre Andersen model. The fractional regime leads to initial economic stress. On the other hand we demonstrate that the average capital required to recover a company after ruin does not change when switching to the fractional Poisson regime.

Basically, a grid trading strategy is a method that seeks to make profit on the market movements of the underlying financial instrument by positioning buy and sell orders properly time-spaced (grid distance). The main advantage of the grid trading strategy is the financial sustainability of the algorithm because it provides a robust way to mediate losses in financial transactions even though this also means very complicated trades management algorithm. For these reasons, grid trading is certainly one of the best approaches to be used in high frequency trading (HFT) strategies. Due to the high level of unpredictability of the financial markets, many investment funds and institutional traders are opting for the HFT (high frequency trading) systems, which allow them to obtain high performance due to the large number of financial transactions executed in the short-term timeframe. The combination of HFT strategies with the use of machine learning methods for the financial time series forecast, has significantly improved the capability and overall performance of the modern automated trading systems. Taking this into account, the authors propose an automatic HFT grid trading system that operates in the FOREX (foreign exchange) market. The performance of the proposed algorithm together with the reduced drawdown confirmed the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.","Author Keywords":"Data forecasting; Financial time-series; Machine learning"}

To evaluate the evolution of stock price predictability at the millisecond timeframe and to examine whether it is consistent with the newly formed adaptive market hypothesis, we develop three artificial stock markets using a strongly typed genetic programming (STGP) trading algorithm. We simulate real-life trading by applying STGP to millisecond data of the three highest capitalized stocks: Apple, Exxon Mobil, and Google and observe that profit opportunities at the millisecond time frame are better modelled through an evolutionary process involving natural selection, adaptation, learning, and dynamic evolution than by using conventional analytical techniques. We use combinations of forecasting techniques as benchmarks to demonstrate that different heuristics enable artificial traders to be ecologically rational, making adaptive decisions that combine forecasting accuracy with speed. \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Author Keywords":"adaptive market hypothesis; efficient market hypothesis; evolutionary computation; genetic programming; high-frequency trading; market efficiency"}

First, we propose a trading system that can predict the number of shares to trade. Specifically, we design an automated system that predicts the number of shares by adding a deep neural network (DNN) regressor to a deep Q-network, thereby combining reinforcement learning and a DNN. Second, we study various action strategies that use Q-values to analyze which action strategies are beneficial for profits in a confused market. Finally, we propose transfer learning approaches to prevent overfitting from insufficient financial data. We use four different stock indices\u2014the S&P500, KOSPI, HSI, and EuroStoxx50\u2014to experimentally verify our proposed methods and then conduct extensive research. The proposed automated trading system, which enables us to predict the number of shares with the DNN regressor, increases total profits by four times in S&P500, five times in KOSPI, 12 times in HSI, and six times in EuroStoxx50 compared with the fixed-number trading system. When the market situation is confused, delaying the decision to buy or sell increases total profits by 18% in S&P500, 24% in KOSPI, and 49% in EuroStoxx50. Further, transfer learning increases total profits by twofold in S&P500, 3 times in KOSPI, twofold in HSI, and 2.5 times in EuroStoxx50. The trading system with all three proposed methods increases total profits by 13 times in S&P500, 24 times in KOSPI, 30 times in HSI, and 18 times in EuroStoxx50, outperforming the market and the reinforcement learning model. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Deep Q-learning; Reinforcement learning; Stock trading; Trading strategy; Transfer learning"}

It focuses on the UK regime. The insights derived are envisaged to be helpful guides for participants and regulators in financial markets. Design\/methodology\/approach: This paper used the legal-economics perspective. It relied on primary data from statutes and regulations and secondary data from the public domain to analyze the phenomenon. The analytical framework comprised the following sections: Introduction, MiFID I review, MiFID II scope, MiFID II key concerns and concluding remarks. Findings: Only half of the EU Member States including the UK managed to transpose MiFID II within the 3rd January 2018 effective date. At this early stage of implementation, various teething problems were encountered. These pertained to costs and charges reporting, firm governance, product governance, transaction reporting, best execution and research. Owing to the sheer scale and complexity of MIFID II, most entities barely coped with their reporting obligations. Noting the situation, the Financial Conduct Authority assured firms taking all sufficient steps that they would be treated fairly. Research limitations\/implications: The paper was not sufficiently empirical. However, the study benefited reasonably from triangulation of data and perspectives to provide good insights on the implementation effects of the complex and voluminous EU rules for governing financial markets with global implications. Practical implications: Investors could gain from the enhanced transparency and best execution rules. Investment banks could gain from the emerging resilient, integrated and efficient financial markets. Regulators with better access to more and higher quality reporting could intervene more effectively when required. Originality\/value: This paper assembled and critically analyzed currently available research insights in these areas so as to provide useful guidance to those needing to work and comply with MiFID II rules and academics teaching financial services law. \u00a9 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Author Keywords":"Dark pools; High frequency trading; MiFID II; MiFIR; Organised trading facility; Transparency reporting"}

A general problem formulation is proposed by considering the design targets subject to a leverage constraint.

In 2019, most securities trading is conducted electronically on digital markets. One type of trading strategy, high-frequency trading, utilizes algorithms, data centers, fiber optic cables, and supercomputers to obtain an edge in the market. High-frequency trading has leveraged advancements in technology to constitute over half of all trading volume in a given day. High-frequency trading, however, has come under scrutiny in recent years as it has increased market susceptibility to certain forms of criminal conduct. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the first conviction of a high-frequency trader for spoofing, a type of trader misconduct that is made more susceptible by high-frequency trading. While scholars have debated whether high-frequency trading should be regulated more than other types of trading and if so, what the regulations might look like, no one has analyzed criminal law as a vehicle to regulate high-frequency trading. This Comment makes the case that individual criminal liability is an ideal tool to regulate misconduct in the high-frequency trading space. Two features of high-frequency trading make the strategy particularly challenging to regulate: 1) it is difficult to draw a line between legitimate and illegitimate behavior in high-frequency trading; and 2) it is difficult to pinpoint an exact definition of what high-frequency trading is. Criminal liability has several advantages over civil liability with respect to these challenges. First, the mens rea component and higher standard of proof required in criminal liability will ensure that high-frequency traders found criminally liable engaged in illegitimate behavior with a higher degree of certainty. Second, the threat of criminal prosecution will better serve the goal of deterring high-frequency trader misconduct. Within the context of criminal liability, individual criminal liability is preferable to corporate criminal liability because the former better furthers the goal of deterrence. The identity problem that corporate liability helps to solve\u2014in some corporate contexts it is impossible to pinpoint culpability on any single individual\u2014is not an issue in high-frequency trading; and individual criminal liability is socially more preferable as a matter of policy. Accordingly, the government should increase criminal enforcement of high-frequency traders to promote its goal of safeguarding market integrity. \u00a9 2019 by Orlando Cosme Jr.","Author Keywords":null}

High Frequency Traders (HFTs) utilize sophisticated algorithms operating with extreme speed and are frequently cited as liquidity providers. The objective of this paper is to investigate the liquidity provision of a number of HFTs to determine their effects on aggregate marketplace liquidity. We consider a large data set collected from the Australian Securities Exchange throughout 2013, providing a near complete picture of all trading activity. Our method is to consider temporal bar charts, association scatterplots, faceted plots and network diagrams to provide visualizations that yield both novel and conventional insights into how HFTs are operating in the market, specifically with respect to liquidity provision. Consistent with HFTs avoiding adverse selection, our results show that on aggregate, HFTs often consume rather than provide liquidity.

Specifically, the algorithm efficiently determines the optimal non-linear mapping and the corresponding lead\u2013lag structure between two time series. Afterwards, this study explores the use of optimal causal paths as a means for identifying promising stock pairs and for generating buy and sell signals. For this purpose, the established trading strategy exploits information about the leading stock to predict future returns of the following stock. The value-add of the proposed framework is assessed by benchmarking it with variants relying on classic similarity measures and a buy-and-hold investment in the S&P\u00a0500 index. In the empirical back-testing study, the trading algorithm generates statistically and economically significant returns of 54.98% p.a. and an annualized Sharpe ratio of 3.57 after transaction costs. Returns are well superior to the benchmark approaches and do not load on any common sources of systematic risk. The strategy outperforms in the context of cryptocurrencies even in recent times due to the fact that stock returns contain substantial information about the future bitcoin returns. \u00a9 2018, \u00a9 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"Cryptocurrency; Finance; High-frequency trading; Lead\u2013lag structure; Optimal causal path; Statistical arbitrage"}

To tackle this problem, two completely opposite approaches, namely technical and fundamental analysis, emerged. Technical analysis bases its predictions on mathematical indicators constructed on the stocks price, while fundamental analysis exploits the information retrieved from news, profitability, and macroeconomic factors. The competition between these schools of thought has led to many interesting achievements, however, to date, no satisfactory solution has been found. Our work aims to combine both technical and fundamental analysis through the application of data science and machine learning techniques. In this paper, the stock market prediction problem is mapped in a classification task of time series data. Indicators of technical analysis and the sentiment of news articles are both exploited as input. The outcome is a robust predictive model able to forecast the trend of a portfolio composed by the twenty most capitalized companies listed in the NASDAQ100 index. As a proof of real effectiveness of our approach, we exploit the predictions to run a high frequency trading simulation reaching more than 80% of annualized return. This project represents a step forward to combine technical and fundamental analysis and provides a starting point for developing new trading strategies. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Market trend prediction; Sentiment analysis; Sentiment embeddings; Supervised learning; Technical analysis; Time series analysis"}

Here we consider the converse idea, that using the stock price as the ground-truth in the system may be a better indication of sentiment. Tweets are labelled as Buy or Sell dependent on whether the stock price discussed rose or fell over the following hour, and from this, stock-specific dictionaries are built for individual companies. A Bayesian classifier is used to generate stock predictions, which are input to an automated trading algorithm.

The theoretical part introduces a set of equations and presents an Agent Based Model implemented via a computer-based simulation. The wide spread leads to the appearance of unusual phenomena caused by the relative speed difference between the fast and slow traders. The latter agents tend to quote limit orders that look irrational, as they are distant more than one tick from the top-of-book. The same relative speed difference causes slow traders to post market orders that execute at price worse than originally intended. Both these abnormal orders tend to increase local volatility. Other results found by the simulation are an increase in global volatility (computed both as the difference of maximum less minimum price and as standard deviation of price distribution) and in volatility at sub-second timescales. These occurrences penalise slower traders and affect market stability. All the results are consistent both under quiet and stressed market conditions. The results found are then compared with audit trail data to verify the soundness of theory against practice. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Bad deals; High-frequency trading; Market stability; Na\u00efve orders; Volatility"}

When a trading opportunity presents itself, the human traders are notified to determine whether or not to execute the trade. The Semantic Web, Web Services, and URML technologies are used to enable this mechanism. The human traders are notified of the trade at the optimal time so as not to either waste their resources or lose a good trading opportunity.

This largely explains the numerous technical indicators that rely on both volume and price data. The foreign exchange market is characterized by the liquidity it offers on large trades, the 24-hour access it provides to participants, the great number of traded currencies and the absence of a predetermined contract size. Leverage is readily accessible for the investor\/hedger with margin requirements. Contrary to stocks, transaction costs are very small. Large operators are able to reduce brokerage fees and therefore incur mainly liquidity costs. Both the low transaction cost feature and the high liquidity of Forex allow for high-frequency trading, which would not be possible for other markets. Electronic broking systems are multilateral trading platforms that market participants use to trade between themselves. These systems record all the transactions for a large panel of market participants. They are one of the most accurate sources of data for the transactions occurring in the foreign exchange markets. One of the main objectives of electronic broking system (EBS) was to provide effective competition to the system provided by Reuters. Since then EBS has obtained a large share of the spot FX broking market. It is now considered the world's leading electronic foreign exchange Broker. The EBS screen displays all the necessary trading information that a spot trader requires to trade efficiently in the currency markets. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Author Keywords":null}

These algorithms are usually referred as technical analysis. However, traders prefer to use a combination of several algorithms as indicators, rather than choosing a single one. The several signals provided are used to determine the trader order to buy or sell some stocks, or even to decide to not submit any order. In the last years, some researchers have tried to create new algorithms with learning skills in order to produce autonomous automatic traders, some of them using AI techniques. Inspired by the human traders' decision processes, our architectural approach composes heterogeneous autonomous trader agents in a competitive multiagent system. This architecture allows the use of several algorithms, based on different technical analysis indexes to manage portfolios. We have implemented this architecture and we have performed a set of simulation experiments using real-data from NASDAQ stock market. The experimental results were compared to the performance of single agents playing alone, and a better global performance was observed when traders compete with each other for resources. These preliminary results indicate that competition among agents, as proposed here, may reach very good results, even among agents created to act alone in this kind of market.","Author Keywords":"Automated trading; Multiagent architecture; Multiagent systems"}

We tackle these issues in the context of algorithmic trading, where sequential decisions need to be made quickly as new data points arrive, and where the data generating process may change continuously with time. We propose a master algorithm that evolves a pool of on-line SVR experts and learns to trade by dynamically weighting the experts' opinions.

This paper demonstrates how solely relying on advances in computer hardware to accelerate market VaR estimation overlooks significant opportunities for acceleration. We use a simulation based delta-gamma Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimate and compute the loss function using basic linear algebra subroutines (BLAS). Our NVIDIA GeForce GTX280 graphics processing unit (GPU) based baseline implementation is a straight-forward port from the CPU implementation and only had a 8.21x speed advantage over a quadcore Intel Core2 Q9300 central processing unit (CPU) based implementation. We demonstrate three approaches to gain additional speedup over the baseline GPU implemention. Firstly, we reformulate the loss function to reduce the amount of necessary computation and achieved a 60.3x speedup. Secondly, we selected functionally equivalent distribution conversion modules to give the best convergence rate - providing an additional 2x speedup. Thirdly, we merged data-parallel computational kernels to remove redundant load store operations leading to an additional 1.85x speedup. Overall, we have achieved a speedup of 148x against the baseline GPU implementation, reducing the time of a VaR estimation with a standard error of 0.1% from minutes to less than one second.

An initial look at financial time series gives the impression that they are random in nature. If true, this would make the forecast, and therefore the trading, of such series exceptionally difficult. The efficient market hypothesis states that the current price contains all available information in the market. This leads to the predictability of most financial time series as being a rather controversial issue. Experts have been forecasting and trading financial markets for decades, using their knowledge and expertise in recognizing patterns and interpreting current financial data. This paper extends the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System to create an expert system that is capable of using fuzzy reasoning combined with the pattern recognition capability of neural networks to be used in financial forecasting and trading. The novelty of the approach lies in its application to the field of high frequency finance. Such an approach has not been used so far with high frequency trading or as a part of an automated trading strategy. This has produced an expert trading system which overcomes the physical limitations of human experts and traders in taking multiple decisions at extremely short time intervals. This means the system can perform predictions and trading decisions at a very high frequency using intra-day data. \u00a9 2009 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Efficient market hypothesis; Financial prediction; High frequency trading; Neuro-fuzzy inference system"}

Although there is a widespread discussion on the pros and cons of Algorithmic Trading and on its impact on market volatility and market quality, little is known on how algorithms actually place their orders in the market and whether and in which respect this differs form other order submissions.

When multiple co-evolving data streams are observed, an important task is to determine how these streams depend on each other, accounting for dynamic dependence patterns without imposing any restrictive probabilistic law governing this dependence. In this paper we argue that flexible least squares (FLS), a penalized version of ordinary least squares that accommodates for time-varying regression coefficients, can be deployed successfully in this context. Our motivating application is statistical arbitrage, an investment strategy that exploits patterns detected in financial data streams. We demonstrate that FLS is algebraically equivalent to the well-known Kalman filter equations, and take advantage of this equivalence to gain a better understanding of FLS and suggest a more efficient algorithm. Promising experimental results obtained from a FLS-based algorithmic trading system for the S&P 500 Futures Index are reported. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Alternating decision tree (ADT), which is implemented with Logitboost, was chosen as the underlying algorithm. One of the strengths of our approach is that the algorithm is able to select the best combination of rules derived from well-known technical analysis indicators and is also able to select the best parameters of the technical indicators. Additionally, the online learning layer combines the output of several ADTs and suggests a short or long position. Finally, the risk management layer can validate the trading signal when it exceeds a specified non-zero threshold and limit the application of our trading strategy when it is not profitable. We test the expert weighting algorithm with data of 100 randomly selected companies of the S & P 500 index during the period 2003-2005. We find that this algorithm generates abnormal returns during the test period. Our experiments show that the boosting approach is able to improve the predictive capacity when indicators are combined and aggregated as a single predictor. Even more, the combination of indicators of different stocks demonstrated to be adequate in order to reduce the use of computational resources, and still maintain an adequate predictive capacity. \u00a9 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Author Keywords":"Algorithmic trading; Automated trading; Boosting; Machine learning"}

Deriving optimal execution strategies that minimize transaction costs, automated trading engines need to forecast future liquidity levels. By means of an empirical study we provide evidence that the publication of regulatory corporate disclosures is followed by abnormal liquidity levels. As we do not find abnormal liquidity levels prior to the publication, we assume the content to be largely unanticipated. Forecasting models purely based on quantitative input data may therefore not be able to pick up on the liquidity trends in a timely manner. Against this background, we propose two trading signals that allow automated trading engines to appropriately react to news-related liquidity shocks: First, a simple binary \"news\" or \"no news\" signal. Second, a signal that indicates whether or not the publication of a regulatory corporate disclosure will be followed by a negative liquidity shock. Utilizing text mining techniques, the content of the corporate disclosures is analyzed to extract the trading signal. The trading signals are evaluated within a simulation-based use case and turn out to be valuable. We strongly advise developers of automated trading engines to integrate unstructured qualitative data into their models, i.e. the proposed trading signals.","Author Keywords":"And simulation; Automated trading; E-finance; Forecasting; Liquidity; Text mining"}

To train these engines they need large datasets of information with highly accurate timestamps that cover long periods with differing trading conditions. Thus, the demand for temporal news datasets beyond the point where full archives are available is increasing. Rebuilding the actual temporal news dataset that was transmitted to the market relies on merging multiple datasets, each with incomplete information and sometimes questionable quality. Doing so requires near duplicate detection in a very large dataset including news in many languages. This research is novel as in our scenario we are unaware of the language used in any given news article.

Under this approach to wealth maximization, automated trading focuses on the process determining directional trades for individual securities based upon the receipt and interpretation of new data. This paper presents a stochastic price formation algorithm that implements a cognitive decision making system modeled by twin radial basis function artificial neural networks to produce a high frequency automated trading system for individual equity securities listed on U.S. exchanges. The overall effectiveness and efficiency of the automated trading system is calibrated by estimating non-parametric quasi elasticity coefficients for individual firm fundamental characteristics. We find that automation driven by cognitive science can effectively auto-trade securities and produce changes to individual wealth that equals or exceeds the performance generated by a simple buy-and-hold strategy. We also identify four fundamental firm factors that explain the ability of the automated trading algorithm to produce a measured level of percent-positive trades. \u00a9 Izmir University of Economics, Turkey, 2010.","Author Keywords":"Artificial neural networks; Automated trading; Cognitive science; Stochastic models"}

The TRRL is a regime-switching extension of the recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) algorithm. The basic RRL model was proposed by Moody and Wu (1997) and used for uncovering trading strategies. We argue that the RRL is not sufficiently equipped to capture the non-linearities and structural breaks present in financial data, and propose the TRRL model as a more suitable algorithm for such environments. This paper gives a detailed description of the TRRL and compares its performance with that of the basic RRL model in a simple automated trading framework using daily data from four well-known European indices. We assume a frictionless setting and use volatility as an indicator variable for switching between regimes. We find that the TRRL produces better trading strategies in all the cases studied, and demonstrate that it is more apt at finding structure in non-linear financial time series than the standard RRL. \u00a9 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Author Keywords":"Automated trading; Differential Sharpe ratio; Regime-switching; Reinforcement learning"}

This kind of information is rarely used on autonomous trading, because most of the agents deal only with technical information, which is composed by price and volume time series. Furthermore, we do not find a open source stock market simulator with support to fundamentalist trader agents. We then created a significantly extended version of the open source financial market simulation tool, called AgEx. This designed version provides also fundamentalist information about the trader's assets. As well as, makes more efficient the exchange of messages within AgEx. This efficiency allows traders that may submit orders in very short intervals of just some seconds or even some fraction of second, to use AgEx as a test platform. Using this new version of AgEx, we implemented and tested the multiagent system based on fundamentalist agents, that we call FAS. The achieved results are presented and analyzed. \u00a9 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Author Keywords":"automated trading; autonomous agents; multiagent systems"}

However, many scenarios require continuous, online processing of data streams and events. We present ESC, a new stream computing engine. It is designed for computations with real-time demands, such as online data mining. It offers a simple programming model in which programs are specified by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The DAG defines the data flow of a program, vertices represent operations applied to the data. The data which are streaming through the graph are expressed as key\/value pairs. ESC allows programmers to focus on the problem at hand and deals with distribution and fault tolerance. Furthermore, it is able to adapt to changing computational demands. In the cloud, ESC can dynamically attach and release machines to adjust the computational capacities to the current needs. This is crucial for stream computing since the amount of data fed into the system is not under the platform's control. We substantiate the concepts we propose in this paper with an evaluation based on a high-frequency trading scenario. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Adaptability; Event processing; Stream computing"}

High-frequency trading data arrive at random times. By combining stochastic and agent-based approaches, we develop a model for trading time, trading volume, and price changes. We generate intertrade time (time between successive trades) \u0394 ti, and the number of shares traded q(\u0394 ti) as two independent but power-law autocorrelated processes, where \u0394 ti is subordinated to q(\u0394 ti), and \u0394 ti is more strongly correlated than q(\u0394 ti). These two power-law autocorrelated processes are responsible for the emergence of strong power-law correlations in (a) the total number of shares traded N(\u0394T) and (b) the share volume Q \u0394T calculated as the sum of the number of shares q i traded in a fixed time interval \u0394T. We find that even though q(\u0394 ti) is weakly power-law correlated, due to strong power-law correlations in \u0394 ti, the (integrated) share volume Q(\u0394T) \u2261\u03a3 \u0394T i=1q(\u0394t i) exhibits strong long-range power-law correlations. We propose that intertrade times and bid-ask price changes share the same volatility mechanism, yielding the power-law autocorrelations in absolute values of price change and power-law tails in the distribution of price changes. The model generates the log-linear functional relationship between the average bid-ask spread \u3008S\u3009 \u0394T and the number of trade occurrences N \u0394T, and between \u3008S\u3009 \u0394T and Q \u0394T.

This approach takes advantage of boosting's feature selection capability to select an optimal combination of technical indicators and design a new set of trading rules. We tested this approach with high-frequency data of the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index Futures (FESX) and the DAX Futures (FDAX) for March 2009. Our method was implemented with different learning algorithms and outperformed a combination of the same group of technical analysis indicators using the parameters typically recommended by practitioners. We incorporated this method of model calibration in a trading agent that relies on a layered structure consisting of the machine learning algorithm described above, an online learning utility, a trading strategy, and a risk management overlay. The online learning layer combines the output of several experts and suggests a short or long position. If the expected position is positive (negative), the trading agent sends a buy (sell) limit order at prices slightly lower (higher) than the bid price at the top of the buy (sell) order book less (plus) transaction costs. If the order is not 100% filled within a fixed period (i.e. 1 minute) of being issued, the existent limit orders are cancelled, and limit orders are reissued according to the new experts' forecast. As part of its risk management capability, the trading agent eliminates any weak trading signal. The trading agent algorithm generated positive returns for the two major European index futures (FESX and FDAX) and outperformed a buy-and-hold strategy. \u00a9 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Author Keywords":"Agent based economics; Algorithmic trading; Automated trading; Boosting; Machine learning; Trading agents"}

The method is tested on FOREX data series and achieved a considerable profit on the mid price.

The RSRRL is a regime-switching extension of the recurrent reinforcement learning (RRL) algorithm. The basic RRL model was proposed by Moody and Wu (Proceedings of the IEEE\/IAFE 1997 on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering (CIFEr). IEEE, New York, pp 300-307 1997) and presented as a methodology to solve stochastic control problems in finance. We argue that the RRL is unable to capture all the intricacies of financial time series, and propose the RSRRL as a more suitable algorithm for such type of data. This paper gives a description of two variants of the RSRRL, namely a threshold version and a smooth transition version, and compares their performance to the basic RRL model in automated trading and portfolio management applications. We use volatility as an indicator\/transition variable for switching between regimes. The out-of-sample results are generally in favour of the RSRRL models, thereby supporting the regime-switching approach, but some doubts exist regarding the robustness of the proposed models, especially in the presence of transaction costs. \u00a9 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Author Keywords":null}

These changes occurred earlier for NASDAQ stocks (primarily between 1994 and 2004) and later for NYSE-listed stocks (mostly following Reg NMS and the 2006 introduction of the NYSE hybrid market). This paper surveys the evidence of how these changes impacted market quality and shows that overall market quality has improved significantly, including bid-ask spreads, liquidity, and transitory price impacts (measured by short-term variance ratios). The greater improvement in market quality for NYSE-listed stocks relative to NASDAQ stocks beginning in 2006 suggests causal links between the staggered market structure changes and market quality. Using proprietary data sets, provided by two exchanges, that identify the activity of high frequency trading firms, studies show these firms contributed directly to narrowing bid-ask spreads, increasing liquidity, and reducing intraday transitory pricing errors and intraday volatility.

With the rapid increases in algorithmic or high frequency trading in which trader make trading decisions by analyzing data patterns rather than fundamental factors affecting stock prices, both technical analyses and time series analyses become more relevant. In this study the authors apply the traditional time series decomposition (TSD), Holt\/Winters (H\/W) models, Box-Jenkins (B\/J) methodology, and neural network (NN) to 50 randomly selected stocks from September 1, 1998 to December 31, 2010 with a total of 3105 observations for each company's close stock price. This sample period covers high tech boom and bust, the historical 9\/11 event, housing boom and bust, and the recent serious recession and current slow recovery.

All three time series approaches fit the data extremely well with R2 being around 0.995.

For many years, many manifestations of TF such as a software program called Turtle Trader, for example, emerged in the industry. Surprisingly little has been studied in academic research about its algorithms and applications. Unlike financial forecasting, TF does not predict any market movement; instead it identifies a trend at early time of the day, and trades automatically afterwards by a pre-defined strategy regardless of the moving market directions during run time. Trend following trading has been popular among speculators. However it remains as a trading method where human judgment is applied in setting the rules (aka the strategy) manually. Subsequently the TF strategy is executed in pure objective operational manner. Finding the correct strategy at the beginning is crucial in TF. This usually involves human intervention in first identifying a trend, and configuring when to place an order and close it out, when certain conditions are met. In this paper, we evaluated and compared a collection of TF algorithms that can be programmed in a computer system for automated trading. In particular, a new version of TF called trend recalling model is presented. It works by partially matching the current market trend with one of the proven successful patterns from the past. Our experiments based on real stock market data show that this method has an edge over the other trend following methods in profitability. The results show that TF however is still limited by market fluctuation (volatility), and the ability to identify trend signal. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, many factors contribute to the complexity of developing such integrated decision-making systems. Some of these factors include: the inherent diversity of financial assets, the heterogeneity of trading and risk assessment strategies, and the highly dynamic nature of financial markets. Moreover, the large volume of data to be analyzed severely affects the system's ability to make timely decisions, especially, for high-frequency trading. This paper proposes a novel Holonic Intelligent Multi-Agent Algorithmic Trading System (HIMAATS) to address the software functional requirements (multi-asset, multi-strategy, real-time risk assessment, etc.), and non-functional requirements (autonomy, high-throughput, low-latency, modularity, scalability, etc.).","Author Keywords":"Algorithmic Trading Systems; Holonic Systems; MultiAgent Systems"}

For instance, some investors prefer to have a lower bound risk rather than gaining a higher return. In portfolio theory, it is commonly assumed the existence of one risk free asset that offers a positive return. This theoretical risk free asset combined with a risky portfolio creates a new portfolio that presents a linear relation between risk and return as the risk free asset weight (w f ) changes. Hence, any level of risk or of return is easy to achieve separately, just by changing w f . However, in a world without any risk free assets, the combination between assets creates nonlinear portfolios. Achieving a specific level of risk or return is not a trivial task. In this paper, we assume a risky world rather than the existence of a risk free asset, in order to model an automated asset management system. Furthermore, some automated asset managers give very different results when evolving in different contexts: hence, a very profitable manager can have very bad results in other market situations. This paper presents a multiagent architecture, aiming to tackle these problems. The architecture, named COAST (COmpetitive Agent SocieTy), is based on competitive agents that act autonomously on behalf of an investor in financial asset management. It allows the simultaneous and competitive use of several asset analysis techniques currently applied in the finance field. Some dedicated agents, called advisors, apply a particular technique to a single asset. The results provided by these advisors are then submitted to and analyzed by a special agent called coach, who evaluates its advisors' performance and defines an expectation about the future price of one specific asset. Within COAST, several coaches negotiate to define the best money allocation among different assets, by using a negotiation protocol defined in this paper. We also propose an investor description model that is able to represent different investors' preferences with defined acceptable limits of risk and\/or return. The COAST architecture was designed to operate adequately with any possible investor's preference. It was implemented using a financial market simulator called AgEx and tested using real data from the Nasdaq stock exchange. The test results show that the architecture performed well when compared to an adjusted market index. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Author Keywords":"Automated asset management; Automated trading; Multiagent architectures; Multiagent systems"}

Most trading systems have concentrated on using common analytic waveforms and have not taken into consideration phasors and complex variables. The Hilbert transform, often employed to convert signal variables in analytic waveforms to complex variables, will be used for the measurement of market cycles, rather than measurement of market trends. The main objective is to investigate how the periods of the dominant cycle in a cycle mode can be quantified in order to create an amplitude compensation of the In-Phase and Quadrature components, alongside methods of smoothing and de-trending the analytic signal. The subsequent output can be defuzzified using Type 2 Fuzzy-Logic techniques, which will in turn refine the implementation of trading strategies. Type-2 Fuzzy Logic systems are becoming more popular as they account for uncertainties that are not captured within a Type-1 Fuzzy Logic system. These Type-2 systems outperform traditional Fuzzy Logic systems in forecasting problems since they can account for more variables in a more efficient way. \u00a9 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In this paper, we propose a RRL trading system which utilizes the price information, jointly with the indicators from technical analysis, fundamental analysis and econometric analysis, to produce long\/short signals for daily trading. In the proposed trading system, we use a genetic algorithm as a pre-screening tool to search suitable indicators for RRL trading. Moreover, we modify the original RRL parameter update scheme in the literature for out-of-sample trading. Empirical studies are conducted based on data sets of 238 S&P stocks.

Financial economists approach finance theory by focusing on whether to reject a pricing model based on hypothesis tests. However, this approach often fails to capture aspects of the model and latent information in the data that could be potentially useful to the investor. Owing to these limitations, investors have increasingly turned to high-frequency trading as a means of achieving risk-mitigated wealth appreciation. High frequency trading is a strategy that relies on professional proprietary formula-driven trading algorithms to execute millisecond trades using high-speed computers that are placed near or in the proximity of the exchanges to reduce order latency time. The contemporary impact of this new approach has increased the speed and complexity of trading, and has had an impact on market liquidity and transparency. In turn, this has attracted the attention of regulators who are \"Clamping Down on Rapid Trades in the Stock Market\" [3] and the risk of such trades to create volatility by flooding the market with orders before canceling these same orders in fractions of seconds. Facing the possibility of regulatory oversight, many highfrequency automated traders are now turning to the alternative of near high-frequency trading. Instead of focusing on strategies to implement strategic runs in the millisecondenvironment, using the highest resolution data available, near high-frequency trading solves complex econometric models on an instrument by instrument basis to predict the profitability of a future trade. In this paper we present a theory of stochastic price formation to form a behavioral near high frequency automated trading system. The new system is actuated by a combining dual radial basis function artificial neural networks and two fundamental trading metrics. Additionally, because the trading signals are generated by cognitive models, the research calibrates a nonparametric behavioral production function to estimate the quasi elasticity coefficients of a four factor model. \u00a9 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The main purpose of this study is laid on examining the role of IT based stock trading on financial market efficiency. This research specifically focused on algorithmic trading. Algorithmic trading enables investors to trade stocks through a computer program without the need for human interventions. Based on an empirical analysis of the Korean stock market, this study discovered the positive impact of algorithmic trading on stock market efficiency at three-fold. First, the study results indicate that algorithmic trading contributes to the reduction in asymmetric volatility, which causes inefficiency of information in a stock market. Second, an algorithmic trading also increases the operation efficiency of a stock market. Arbitrage trading contributes on the equilibrium between the spot market and futures market as well as on the price discovery. Third, algorithmic trading provides liquidity for market participants contributing to friction free transactions. The research results indicate that stock exchanges based on electronic communications networks (ECNs) without human intervention could augment a financial market quality by increasing trading share volumes and market efficiency so that it can eventually contribute to the welfare of market investors. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Author Keywords":"Asymmetric volatility; Efficiency of information; Efficiency of operation; Equilibrium; Liquidity"}

This study demonstrates the existence of predictable short-term trends in the market; understanding the probability of price movement can be useful to high-frequency traders. Price movement was examined in trade-by-trade (tick) data along with temporal timespans between 1 s to 30 min for 52 one-week periods for one highly-traded stock. We hypothesize that much of the initial predictability of trade-by-trade (tick) data is due to traditional market dynamics, or the bouncing of the price between the stock's bid and ask. Only after timespans of between 5 to 10 s does this cease to explain the predictability; after this timespan, two consecutive movements in the same direction occur with higher probability than that of movements in the opposite direction. This pattern holds up to a one-minute interval, after which the strength of the pattern weakens. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Advanced data feed and audit trail information from market operators now make the full observation of market participants' actions possible. A key question is the extent to which it is possible to understand and characterize the behavior of individual participants from observations of trading actions. In this paper, we consider the basic problems of categorizing and recognizing traders (or, equivalently, trading algorithms) on the basis observed limit orders. Our approach, which is based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), is to model trading decisions as a Markov decision process and then use observations of an optimal decision policy to find the reward function. The approach strikes a balance between two desirable features in that it captures key empirical properties of order book dynamics and yet remains computationally tractable. Making use of a real-world data set from the E-Mini futures contract, we compare two principal IRL variants, linear IRL and Gaussian process IRL. Results suggest that IRL-based feature spaces support accurate classification and meaningful clustering. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Algorithmic Trading; Behavioral Finance; Gaussian Process; High Frequency Trading; Inverse Reinforcement Learning; Markov Decision Process; Support Vector Machine"}

The questions rise if high frequency trading (HFT) provides more efficient, liquid markets and is economically beneficial. In this paper an algorithm based on statistical arbitrage is tested. Statistical arbitrage is a well-known trading strategy where profit arises from pricing inefficiencies between correlated financial instruments. An algorithm of statistical arbitrage tries to find a pair of correlated instruments that move together and take long\/short positions when they diverge abnormally, hoping that the prices will converge in the near future. Recent computational expansion in financial modeling and the ever increasing demand for order execution speed is moving market making and price discovery strategies into high frequency trading (HFT) or the milliseconds realm, where HFT already generates nearly 2\/3 of the overall trading volume. In this report we apply high frequency data from NYMEX exchange to test a trading system based on statistical arbitrage in one of the most liquid futures market, i.e. natural gas futures. The overall results suggest that statistical arbitrage in HFT environment significantly outperforms traditional trading strategies, provides liquidity to the markets and denies the efficient market hypothesis. \u00a9 Vilnius University, 2002-2014 \u00a9 Brno University of Technology, 2002-2014 \u00a9 University of Latvia, 2002-2014.","Author Keywords":"Algorithmic trading; Efficient market hypothesis; Futures market; High frequency trading; Pairs trading; Statistical arbitrage"}

The proposed generator incorporates the information within order book microstructure and market news to provide directional predictions. The MM strategy in the second tier trades on the signals and prevents itself from profit loss led by market trending.

This paper proposes an expert system that uses novel machine learning techniques to predict the price return over these seasonal events, and then uses these predictions to develop a profitable trading strategy. While simple approaches to trading these regularities can prove profitable, such trading leads to potential large drawdowns (peak-to-trough decline of an investment measured as a percentage between the peak and the trough) in profit. In this paper, we introduce an automated trading system based on performance weighted ensembles of random forests that improves the profitability and stability of trading seasonality events. An analysis of various regression techniques is performed as well as an exploration of the merits of various techniques for expert weighting. The performance of the models is analysed using a large sample of stocks from the DAX. The results show that recency-weighted ensembles of random forests produce superior results in terms of both profitability and prediction accuracy compared with other ensemble techniques. It is also found that using seasonality effects produces superior results than not having them modelled explicitly. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper provides new insights into improving the time-varying risk-adjusted performance of trading systems controlled by Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Systems (ANFIS) or Dynamic Evolving Neuro Fuzzy Systems (DENFIS). Contrary to most former studies which focus on daily predictions, we compare these models in an intraday stock trading scenario using high-frequency data. Firstly, we propose a dynamic extension of the popular moving average rule and enhance it with a model validation methodology using heat maps to analyse favourable profitability in specific holding time and signal regions. Secondly, we study the effect of realistic constraints such as transaction costs and intraday trading hours, which many existing approaches in the literature ignore. Thirdly, unlike most former studies that only aim to minimise statistical error measures, we compare this approach with financially more relevant risk-adjusted objective functions. To this end, we also consider an innovative ANFIS ensemble architecture which on an intraday level dynamically selects between different risk-adjusted models. Our study shows that accounting for transaction costs and the use of risk-return objective functions provide better results in out-of-sample tests. Overall, the ANN model is identified as a viable model, however ANFIS shows more stable time-varying performance across multiple market regimes. Moreover, we find that combining multiple risk-adjusted objective functions using an ANFIS ensemble yields promising results. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"ANFIS; ANFIS ensemble; ANN; DENFIS; Dynamic moving average; High-frequency trading"}

However, the realworld time series, such as those fromnancial markets, are typically taken at irregular time intervals. It is a common practice to resample or bin the irregular time series into a regular one, but there are significant limitations on this practice. For example, if one is to resample the trading activities of a stock into hourly series, then the time series can only last through the trading day, because there usually is no trading in the night. In this work, we explore the dynamics of irregular time series through a high-performance computing algorithm known as Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT).To illustrate its effectiveness, we apply NUFFT on the trading records of natural gas futures contracts for the last seven years. Tests show that NUFFT results accurately capture well-known structural features in the trading records, such as weekly and daily cycles. At the same time the results also reveal unexplored features, such as the presence of multiple power laws. In particular, we observe an emerging power law in the Fourier spectra in recent years. We also detect a strong Fourier component at the precise frequency once per minute, which implies significant automated trading activities might be triggered by clock. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.","Author Keywords":null}

Over the last fifteen years, the use of statistical and econometric methods for analyzing high-frequency financial data has grown exponentially. This growth has been driven by the increasing availability of such data, the technological advancements that make high-frequency trading strategies possible, and the need of practitioners to analyze these data. This comprehensive book introduces readers to these emerging methods and tools of analysis. Yacine A\u00eft-Sahalia and Jean Jacod cover the mathematical foundations of stochastic processes, describe the primary characteristics of high-frequency financial data, and present the asymptotic concepts that their analysis relies on. A\u00eft-Sahalia and Jacod also deal with estimation of the volatility portion of the model, including methods that are robust to market microstructure noise, and address estimation and testing questions involving the jump part of the model. As they demonstrate, the practical importance and relevance of jumps in financial data are universally recognized, but only recently have econometric methods become available to rigorously analyze jump processes. A\u00eft-Sahalia and Jacod approach high-frequency econometrics with a distinct focus on the financial side of matters while maintaining technical rigor, which makes this book invaluable to researchers and practitioners alike. \u00a9 2014 by Princeton University Press.

However, many factors contribute to the complexity of developing such integrated decision-making systems. Some of these factors include: the inherent diversity of financial assets, the heterogeneity of trading and risk assessment strategies, and the highly dynamic nature of financial markets. Moreover, the large volume of data to be analyzed severely affects the system's ability to make timely decisions, especially, for high-frequency trading. This paper proposes a novel Holonic Intelligent Multi-Agent Algorithmic Trading System (HIMAATS) to address the software functional requirements (multi-asset, multi-strategy, real-time risk assessment, etc.), and non-functional requirements (autonomy, high-throughput, low-latency, modularity, scalability, etc.).

Information systems have often been applied to support investors by forecasting price changes in securities markets. In addition to the asset price, liquidity represents another financial variable that has a high relevance for investors because it constitutes a main determinant of total transaction costs. Previous research has shown that the level of liquidity is affected by the publication of corporate disclosures. To derive an optimal order execution strategy that minimises the transaction costs, investors as well as automated trading engines must be able to anticipate changes in the available market liquidity. However, there is no research on how to forecast the impact of corporate disclosures on market liquidity. Therefore, we propose an IT artefact that allows automated trading engines to appropriately react to news-related liquidity shocks. The system indicates whether the publication of a regulatory corporate disclosure will be followed by a positive liquidity shock, i.e.; lower transaction costs compared to historical levels. Utilising text mining techniques, the content of the corporate disclosures is analysed to generate a trading signal. Furthermore, the trading signal is evaluated within a simulation-based use case that considers English and German corporate disclosures and is shown to be of economic value. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Author Keywords":"Automated trading; e-Finance; Forecasting; Liquidity; Simulation; Text mining"}

Whilst many common approaches only consider the bid-ask spread when measuring market impact, the authors aim to analyse the detailed limit order book data, which has more informational content.

The regression coefficients of these curves are estimated, and their intraday patterns are revealed using a nonparametric kernel regression model. Findings: The authors find that market impact is nonlinear, time-varying, and asymmetric. Inferences drawn from marginal probabilities regarding Granger-causality do not show a significant impact of slope coefficients on the opposite side of the limit order book, thus implying that each side of the market is simultaneously rather than sequentially influenced by prevailing market conditions. Research limitations\/implications: Results show that intraday seasonality patterns of liquidity may be exploited through trade scheduling algorithms in an attempt to minimise the trading costs associated with large institutional trades.

We provide a model-free option pricing approach with neural networks, which can be applied to real-time pricing and hedging of FX options. In contrast to well-known theoretical models, an essential advantage of our approach is the simultaneous pricing across different strike prices and parsimonious use of real-time input variables. To test its ability for the purpose of high-frequency trading, we perform an empirical run-time trading simulation with a tick dataset of EUR\/USD options on currency futures of 4 weeks. In very short non-overlapping 15-minute out-of-sample intervals, theoretical option prices derived from the Black model compete against nonparametric option prices through two different neural network topologies. We show that the approximated pricing function of learning networks is suitable for generating fast run-time option pricing evaluation as their performance is slightly better in comparison to theoretical prices. The derivation of the network function is also useful for performing hedging strategies. We conclude that the performance of closed-form pricing models depends highly on the volatility estimator, whereas neural networks can avoid this estimation problem but require market liquidity for training. Nevertheless, we also have to take particular enhancements into account, which give us useful hints for further research and steps.

We show that the reduction in arbitrage opportunities is associated primarily with computers taking liquidity. This result is consistent with the view that AT improves informational efficiency by speeding up price discovery, but that it may also impose higher adverse selection costs on slower traders. In contrast, the reduction in the autocorrelation of returns owes more to the algorithmic provision of liquidity.

The theoretical justification for our solution is based on multivariate statistical analysis of multidimensional investment tasks, particularly on relations between data size, algorithm complexity and portfolio efficacy. To reduce the dimensionality\/sample size problem, a larger task is broken down into smaller parts by means of item similarity - clustering. Similar problems are given to smaller groups to solve. Groups, however, vary in many aspects. Pseudo randomly-formed groups compose a large number of modules of feed-forward decision-making systems. The evolution mechanism forms collections of the best modules for each single short time period. Final solutions are carried forward to the global scale where a collection of the best modules is chosen using a multiclass cost-sensitive perceptron. Collected modules are combined in a final solution in an equally weighted approach (1\/N Portfolio). The efficacy of the novel decision-making approach was demonstrated through a financial portfolio optimization problem, which yielded adequate amounts of real world data. For portfolio construction, we used 11,730 simulated trading robot performances. The dataset covered the period from 2003 to 2012 when environmental changes were frequent and largely unpredictable. Walk-forward and out-of-sample experiments show that an approach based on sustainable economy principles outperforms benchmark methods and that shorter agent training history demonstrates better results in periods of a changing environment. \u00a9 2014 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.","Author Keywords":"Algorithmic trading; Automated trading; Clustering; Markowitz; Mean-variance; Optimization; Portfolio; Portfolio optimization; Regularization; Simulation"}

When an analysis of RRL trading performance is conducted using low frequency financial data (e.g. daily data), the weakening autocorrelation in price changes may lead to a decrease in trading profits as compared to its applications in high frequency trading. There therefore is a need to improve RRL for the purposes of daily equity trading. This paper presents two parameter update schemes (the 'average elitist' and the 'multiple elitist') for RRL. The purpose of the first scheme is to improve out-of-sample performance of RRL-type trading systems. The second scheme aims to exploit serial dependence in stock returns to improve trading performance, when traders deal with highly correlated stocks. Profitability and stability of the trading system are examined by using four groups of S&P stocks for the period January 2009 to December 2012. It is found that the Sharpe ratios of the stocks increase after we use the two parameter update schemes in the RRL trading system. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.","Author Keywords":null}

Therefore, this paper aims to provide the first systematic literature review on the state-of-the-art application of EC techniques for rule discovery in stock AT. Out of 650 articles published before 2013 (inclusive), 51 relevant articles from 24 journals were confirmed. These papers were reviewed and grouped into three analytical method categories (fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and blending analysis) and three EC technique categories (evolutionary algorithm, swarm intelligence, and hybrid EC techniques). A significant bias toward the applications of genetic algorithm-based (GA) and genetic programming-based (GP) techniques in technical trading rule discovery is observed. Other EC techniques and fundamental analysis lack sufficient study. Furthermore, we summarize the information on the evaluation scheme of selected papers and particularly analyze the researches which compare their models with buy and hold strategy (B&H). We observe an interesting phenomenon where most of the existing techniques perform effectively in the downtrend and poorly in the uptrend, and considering the distribution of research in the classification framework, we suggest that this phenomenon can be attributed to the inclination of factor selections and problem in transaction cost selections. We also observe the significant influence of the transaction cost change on the margins of excess return. Other influenced factors are also presented in detail. The absence of ways for market trend prediction and the selection of transaction cost are two major limitations of the studies reviewed. In addition, the combination of trading rule discovery techniques and portfolio selection is a major research gap. Our review reveals the research focus and gaps in applying EC techniques for rule discovery in stock AT and suggests a roadmap for future research. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, automated prediction markets where software trading agents perform market operations such as trading and updating beliefs on behalf of humans have been proposed. A challenging aspect in automated prediction markets is to develop suitable techniques that can be used by automated trading agents to update the price at which they should trade securities related to an event so that they can increase their profit. This problem is nontrivial, as the decision to trade and the price at which trading should occur depends on several dynamic factors, such as incoming information related to the event for which the security is being traded, the belief-update mechanism and risk attitude of the trading agent, and the trading decision and trading prices of other agents. To address this problem, we have proposed a new behavior model for trading agents based on a game-theoretic framework called partially observable stochastic game with information (POSGI). We propose a correlated equilibrium (CE)-based solution strategy for this game that allows each agent to dynamically choose an action (to buy or sell or hold) in the prediction market. We have also performed extensive simulation experiments using the data obtained from the Intrade prediction market for four different prediction markets. Our results show that our POSGI model and CE strategy produces prices that are strongly correlated with the prices of the real prediction markets. Results comparing our CE strategy with five other strategies commonly used in similar market show that our CE strategy improves price predictions and provides higher utilities to the agents compared to other existing strategies. \u00a9 2015 ACM 2157-6904\/2015\/07-ART48 $15.00.","Author Keywords":"Correlated equilibrium; Prediction market; Risk-averse traders; Stochastic game"}

To better understand the societal implications of algorithmic trading, I construct computational agent-based models comprised of investors and algorithmic traders. I examine two overlapping types of algorithmic traders: high-frequency traders, who exploit speed advantages for profit, and market makers, who facilitate trade and supply liquidity by simultaneously maintaining offers to buy and sell. I employ simulation and empirical game-theoretic analysis to study trader behavior in equilibrium, that is, when all traders best- respond to their environment and other agents' strategies. I focus on the impact of algorithmic trading on allocative efficiency, or overall gains from trade, and the potential for a call market, in which orders are matched to trade at periodic intervals, to mitigate the latency advantages of high- frequency traders.

One of the most influential and revolutionary processes in financial markets is algorithmic trading. The focus of this work is to increase trading efficiency by improving the accuracy of intraday volume forecasts, which are used in algorithmic trading. An intraday volume forecast predicts the distribution of trading volume throughout the day, and allows traders to make better decisions regarding the timing and quantity of their trades. An accurate intraday volume forecast is an important input to trading decisions and will ultimately improve traders' ability to meet benchmarks, such as volume weighted average price. This work seeks to understand the performance of three classes of models: moving average, exponentially weighted moving average, and average exponentially weighted moving average, for intra-day volume prediction over a large sample of U.S. equities. For each model, we explore a broad range of parameterizations and seek to understand how various factors affect model performance. Models are evaluated based on a variety of different metrics, such as mean square error and maximum absolute deviation. We report on the best performing models for a variety of stocks and scenarios. Overall, the average exponentially weighted moving average model performed the best across the examined parameters. \u00a9 2015 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Algorithmic Trading; Exponentially Weighted Moving Average; Moving Average; Volume Profile"}

Portfolio allocation is one of the most important problems in financial risk management. One most challenging part in portfolio allocation is the tremendous amount of data and the optimization procedures that require computing power beyond the currently available desktop systems. In this article, we focus on the portfolio allocation problem using high-frequency financial data, and propose a hybrid parallelization solution to carry out efficient asset allocations in a large portfolio via intra-day high-frequency data. We exploit a variety of HPC techniques, including parallel R, Intel Math Kernel Library, and automatic offloading to Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor in particular to speed up the simulation and optimization procedures in our statistical investigations. Our numerical studies are based on high-frequency price data on stocks traded in New York Stock Exchange in 2011. The analysis results show that portfolios constructed using high-frequency approach generally perform well by pooling together the strengths of regularization and estimation from a risk management perspective. We also investigate the computation aspects of large-scale multiple hypothesis testing for time series data. Using a combination of software and hardware parallelism, we demonstrate a high level of performance on high-frequency financial statistics. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"high-frequency financial analysis; Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor; massive parallelism; parallel R"}

The optimization itself is carried out by stochastic search algorithms. The presented solutions satisfy the cardinality constraint thus providing a sparse portfolios which minimizes the transaction costs and maximizes the interpretability of the results.

Instead of the continuous limit order book market design that is currently predominant, we argue that financial exchanges should use frequent batch auctions: uniform price double auctions conducted, for example, every tenth of a second. That is, time should be treated as discrete instead of continuous, and orders should be processed in a batch auction instead of serially. Our argument has three parts. First, we use millisecond-level direct-feed data from exchanges to document a series of stylized facts about how the continuous market works at high-frequency time horizons: (i) correlations completely break down; which (ii) leads to obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities; and (iii) competition has not affected the size or frequency of the arbitrage opportunities, it has only raised the bar for how fast one has to be to capture them. Second, we introduce a simple theory model which is motivated by and helps explain the empirical facts. The key insight is that obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities, like those observed in the data, are built into the market design-continuous-time serial-processing implies that even symmetrically observed public information creates arbitrage rents. These rents harm liquidity provision and induce a never-ending socially wasteful arms race for speed. Last, we show that frequent batch auctions directly address the flaws of the continuous limit order book. Discrete time reduces the value of tiny speed advantages, and the auction transforms competition on speed into competition on price. Consequently, frequent batch auctions eliminate the mechanical arbitrage rents, enhance liquidity for investors, and stop the high-frequency trading arms race. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2015.

The academic roots of this industry-changing deployment of AI technologies can be traced back to research published by a team of researchers at IBM at IJCAI 2001, which was subsequently replicated and extended by De Luca and Cliff at IJCAI 2011 and ICAART 2011. Here, we focus on the order management policy enforced by Open Exchange (OpEx), the open source algorithmic trading system designed by De Luca, for both human and robot traders: while humans are allowed to manage multiple orders simultaneously, robots only deal with one order at the time. We hypothesise that such unbalance may have strongly influenced the victory of human traders over robot traders, reported in past studies by De Luca et al., and by Cartlidge and Cliff. We employed OpEx to implement a multiple-order policy for robots as well as humans, and ran several human vs. robot trading experiments. Using aggregated market metrics and time analysis, we reached two important conclusions. First, we demonstrated that, in mixed human-robot markets, robots dealing multiple simultaneous orders consistently outperform robots dealing one order at a time. And second, we showed that while human traders outperform single-order robot traders under specific circumstances, multiple-order robot traders are never outperformed by human traders. We thus conclude that the performance of robot traders in a human-robot mixed market is strongly influenced by the order management policy they employ.

On March 11, 2011 the disaster of the Great Tohoku Earthquake disaster accompanied by tsunami took place; the event was followed by a highly turbulent market with JPY appreciating without limits in the panic that ensued; major central banks of the world intervened since after to weaken the yen. We analyze the tick data set using the criteria of aggregate volatility, extreme-event distribution, and singular spectrum analysis to discover the market microstructure during the central bank interventions. In addition, a multi-layer neural network algorithm is designed to extract the causality regime on the microscale for each trading day. At the beginning of the month, the success ratios in the trend prediction hit levels as high as the order of 70 %, followed by about a 10-point decrease for the rest of the data set. Distribution of intra-trade times shows clear signs of algorithmic trading with the transaction clock ticking at the time intervals of 0.1, 0.25 and 10.0 s. The extracted trend prediction rates represent lower bounds with respect to other methods.

By extracting key temporal coherent structures (portfolios) in its sampling window, it provides a regression to a best fit linear dynamical system, allowing for a predictive assessment of the market dynamics and informing an investment strategy.

Portfolio allocation is one of the most important problems in financial risk management. One most challenging part in portfolio allocation is the tremendous amount of data and the optimization procedures that require computing power beyond the currently available desktop systems. In this article, we focus on the portfolio allocation problem using high-frequency financial data, and propose a hybrid parallelization solution to carry out efficient asset allocations in a large portfolio via intra-day highfrequency data.We exploit a variety of HPC techniques, including parallel R, Intelr Math Kernel Library, and automatic offloading to Intelr Xeon Phi coprocessor in particular to speed up the simulation and optimization procedures in our statistical investigations. Our numerical studies are based on high-frequency price data on stocks traded in New York Stock Exchange in 2011. The analysis results show that portfolios constructed using high-frequency approach generally perform well by pooling together the strengths of regularization and estimation from a risk management perspective.We also investigate the computation aspects of large-scale multiple hypothesis testing for time series data.

The central idea of the proposed system architecture is decomposing the trading problem into a set of tasks that are handled by distributed autonomous agents under a minimal central coordination. With this kind of architecture, we can take advantage of currently available and future high-performance computing systems. These systems, due to the way computer architecture has evolved in the recent past and foreseeable future, are composed of multiple processor cores. We are implementing the ITA software architecture employing the Carnegie Mellon Navigation (CARMEN) robot control software and using a publish\/subscribe communication model. Together, CARMEN and this communication model allow the implementation of high-performance, scalable parallel computing systems that leverage the architecture of multi-core systems. For this work, we evaluated the data structures and algorithms employed by the symbol module of the ITA software architecture, which is responsible for maintaining the synchronized local copies of exchanges limit order books (LOB) for the instruments traded by the system. Our LOB implementation strongly outperformed a reference implementation in all evaluated parameters by more than one order of magnitude in some cases, achieving average throughputs of 4 million orders\/s when creating new orders, 3 million orders\/s when changing existing orders, and 17 million orders\/s when querying orders.

The investigated method is used to determine potential buy and sell conditions for stocks, aiming to yield robust solutions able to withstand extreme market conditions, while producing high returns at a minimal risk. One of the biggest challenges GP evolved solutions face is over-fitting. GP trading rules need to have similar performance when tested with new data in order to be deployed in a real situation. We explore a random sampling method (RSFGP) which instead of calculating the fitness over the whole dataset, calculates it on randomly selected segments. This method shows improved robustness and out-of-sample results compared to standard genetic programming (SGP) and a volatility adjusted fitness (VAFGP). Trading strategies (TS) are evolved using financial metrics like the volatility, CAPM alpha and beta, and the Sharpe ratio alongside other Technical Indicators (TI) to find the best investment strategy. These strategies are evaluated using 21 of the most liquid stocks of the Spanish market. The achieved results clearly outperform Buy&Hold, SGP and VAFGP. Additionally, the solutions obtained with the training data during the experiments clearly show during testing robustness to step market declines as seen during the European sovereign debt crisis experienced recently in Spain. In this paper the solutions learned were able to operate for prolonged periods, which demonstrated the validity and robustness of the rules learned, which are able to operate continuously and with minimal human intervention. To sum up, the developed method is able to evolve TSs suitable for all market conditions with promising results, which suggests great potential in the method generalization capabilities. The use of financial metrics alongside popular TI enables the system to increase the stock return while proving resilient through time. The RSFGP system is able to cope with different types of markets achieving a portfolio return of 31.81% for the testing period 2009-2013 in the Spanish market, having the IBEX35 index returned 2.67%. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem, however, is that most of these methods is based on daily trading data. When facing the high frequency trading data which is more powerful in short-term forecasting, these methods become incapable. Inspired by the development of Convolutional Neural Network in image recognition tasks, this paper tries to apply the Convolutional Neural Network on the high frequency financial trading data, and has achieved good results. We collect the close price of Shanghai Composite Index from 2006 to 2008 and from 2014 to 2015, about 1000 trading days in total. The frequency of the trading data is 5 min. The paper intends to forecast the stock\u2019s future trend of the next day from historical data, namely, go up or down. First, we apply Hodrick-Prescott decomposition [1] on the original time series. The Hodrick-Prescott filter(decomposition) is a mathematical tool used in macroeconomics to separate the cyclical component ct and trend component \u03c4t from a time series. After preprocessing, the proposed method novelly transforms the time series into pictures. We apply GASF, GADF and MTF algorithm [2] on the time series respectively, forming the R, G and B channels of a picture. By transforming each of the time series into picture mode, the trading time series produces a picture library. Finally, the proposed method uses AlexNet architecture as feature extractor and classifier. The net has five convolution layers, three pooling layers, and two fully-connected layers. In data set of time series from 2006 to 2008, we choose the training data and the testing data randomly, and the proposed method can keep the accuracy at about 0.55 on the binary classification problem. In data set of time series from 2014 to 2015, we choose the last 16 training days of the data set as testing data and the accuracy can reach up to 0.60. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Author Keywords":"Convolutional neural network; Stock forecasting"}

Extracting valuable information from the large data is very urgent. However, because of some limitations such as memory restrictions, data complexity or time complexity, the majority of traditional data mining methods are time consuming and low efficiency working on big data. In contrast, parallel computing is a common and reliable choice to solve that problem. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy rule discovery algorithm - fuzzy rule based classification system in the framework of MapReduce (FRBCS-MR). The proposed FRBCS-MR algorithm applies parallel computing technology to extract fuzzy rules and build fuzzy rule-base, which combines the advantage of dealing with uncertainty of fuzzy system and the ability of MapReduce in parallel computing. Future goods trading has been gradually transformed from the original manual trading to stylized trading and the stylized trading is considered to be the forefront and the most scientific mode of investment. In the experimental studies, the rules extracted by FRBCS-MR algorithm using future goods data are turned into trading strategies which are to be used in the real automated trading platform TradeBlazer (TB) to compute the profit and loss situation.

To this end, a large variety of machine learning algorithms have been examined. However, it is now widely understood that, in real-world trading settings, no single machine learning model can consistently outperform the alternatives. In this work, we examine the efficacy and the feasibility of developing a stacked generalization system, intelligently combining the predictions of diverse machine learning models. Our approach establishes a novel inferential framework that comprises the following levels of data processing: (i) We model the dependence patterns between major currency pairs via a diverse set of commonly used machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), Bayesian autoregressive trees (BART), dense-layer neural networks (NNs), and na\u00efve Bayes (NB) classifiers. (ii) We generate implied signals of exchange rate fluctuation, based on the output of these models, as well as appropriate side information obtained by analyzing the correlations across currency pairs in our training datasets. (iii) We finally combine these implied signals into an aggregate predictive waveform, by leveraging majority voting, genetic algorithm optimization, and regression weighting techniques. We thoroughly test our framework in real-world trading scenarios; we show that our system leads to significantly better trading performance than the considered benchmarks. Thus, it represents an attractive solution for financial firms and corporations that perform foreign exchange portfolio management and daily trading. Our system can be used as an integrated part in international commercial trade activities or in a quantitative investing framework for algorithmic trading and carry-trade speculation. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Author Keywords":"Algorithmic trading; Forex forecasting; Machine learning; Portfolio management; Stacked generalization"}

To develop efficient and effective automated trading strategies, we need to understand the workings of the market and the patterns emerging as a result of the traders interactions. In this paper, we develop an adaptive Genetic Programming (GP) agent-based trading system under Intraday Seasonality Model (ISM), which is abbreviated as GP-ISM trading system. ISM is used for creating maps and visualizing the dynamic price evolution of the asset during the day. This new model permits the recognition of periodic patterns and seasonalities in the price time series and hence eliminates any unnecessary data input. We use a high-frequency dataset of historical price data from Saudi Stock Market, which enables us to run multiple market simulation runs and draw comparisons and conclusions for the developed trading strategies. The goal of our work is to develop automated computational intelligence-based strategies for real markets, and this study facilitates a more thorough understanding of a specific market's workings and constitutes the basis for further exploration into such strategies designed for the stock market. We evaluate the intelligence of the GP-ISM trading system through agent-based simulation market index trading. For comparison, we also include four other types of trading agents in this contest, namely, zero-intelligence agents, Buy-and-Hold agents, fundamental agents and technical analysis agents. As a result, GP-ISM performs the best, which provides a general framework for the further development of automated trading strategies and decision support systems. \u00a9 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

Not only trading highly affected by the accuracy of the price of Asian options but also portfolios that involve hedging of commodity. Several attempts have been made to model the Asian option prices with closed-form over the past twenty years such as the Kemna-Vorst Model and Levy Approximation. Although today the two closed-form models are still widely used, their accuracy and reliability are called into question. The reason is simple; the Kemna-Vorst model is derived with an assumption of geometric mean of the stocks. In practice, Average Priced Options are mostly arithmetic and thus always have a volatility high than the volatility of a geometric mean making the Asian options always underpriced. On the other hand, the Levy Approximation using Monte Carlo Simulation as a benchmark, do not perform well when the product of the sigma (volatility) and square root maturity of the underlying is larger than 0.2. When the maturity of the option enlarges, the performance of the Levy Approximation largely deteriorates. If the closed-form models could be improved, higher frequency trading of Asian option will become possible. Moreover, building neural networks for different contracts of Asian Options allows reuse of computed prices and large-scale portfolio management that involves many contracts. In this thesis, we use Neural Network to fill the gap between the price of a closed-form model and that of an Asian option. The significance of this method answers two interesting questions. First, could an Asian option trader with a systematic behavior in pricing learned from previous quotes improve his pricing or trading performance in the future? Second, will a training set of previous data help to improve the performance of a financial model? We perform two simulation experiments and show that the performance of the closed-form model is significantly improved. Moreover, we extend the learning process to real data quote. The use of Neural Network highly improves the accuracy of the traditional closed-form model. The model's original price is not so much accurate as what we estimate using Neural network and could not capture the high volatility effectively; still, it provides a relative reasonable fit to the problem (Especially the Levy Model). The analysis shows that the Neural Network Algorithms we used affect the results significantly. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Asian Options; Behavioral Finance; Machine Learning; Neural Networks (NNs); Option Pricing"}

The proposed binary classification framework can predict the price trends of Taiwan stock index futures after thirty minutes. Traditional learning-based approaches collect all samples during the training period as the learning materials. The major contribution of this paper is to collect a subset of similar historical financial data to train the real-time trading model. This goal can be achieved by an on-line learning technique which is required to calculate an accurate model with training time limitation. In addition, the proposed joint-AdaBoost algorithm is to improve the system performance based on the concept of paired feature learning and planar weak classifier design. The core execution components in this algorithm can be further accelerated with the aid of Open Computing Language (OpenCL) parallel computing platform. The experimental results show that the proposed learning algorithm can improve the prediction accuracy of final classifier from 53.8% to 61.68%. Compared to the pure CPU implementation, the OpenCL version which uses CPU and GPGPU simultaneously can reduce the calculation time around 83.02 times. The efficiency improvement can decrease the delay of investment opportunity which is a critical issue in real-time financial decision support system application. To sum up, this paper proposed a novel learning framework based on joint-AdaBoost algorithm with similar learning samples and OpenCL parallel computation.

An alternative to this is event-based summaries. Directional changes (DC), which is a new event-based summary method, allows for new regularities in data to be discovered and exploited, as part of trading strategies. Under this paradigm, the timeline is divided in directional change events (upwards or downwards), and overshoot events, which follow exactly after a directional change has been identified. Previous work has shown that the duration of overshoot events is on average twice the duration of a DC event. However, this was empirically observed on the specific currency pairs DC was tested with, and only under the specific time periods the tests took place. Thus, this observation is not easily generalised. In this paper, we build on this regularity, by creating a new event-based indicator. We do this by calculating the average duration time of overshoot events on each training set of each individual dataset we experiment with. This allows us to have tailored duration values for each dataset. Such knowledge is important, because it allows us to more accurately anticipate trend reversal. In order to take advantage of this new indicator, we use a genetic algorithm to combine different DC trading strategies, which use our proposed indicator as part of their decision-making process. We experiment on 5 different foreign exchange currency pairs, for a total of 50 datasets. Our results show that the proposed algorithm is able to outperform its predecessor, as well as other well-known financial benchmarks, such as a technical analysis. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Author Keywords":"Algorithmic trading; Directional changes; Financial forecasting; Genetic algorithms"}

A highly volatile complex behavior is seen during the time the market is open and understanding market trend patterns solves an enormous amount of problems pertaining to prediction and decision making. Many often traders write trading strategies to identify the significant patterns they have recognized. This concept directly involves trading automation or algorithmic trading but building such a versatile algorithm is quite challenging unless you have a person to suggest improvements in your own algorithm. Therefore, in this paper we propose an intelligent system called Genibux will assist Forex traders to improve their strategies. The system suggests improvements with justifications for the maximum gain of profit. Genibux is mainly based on Complex Event Processing and it has been implemented with highly comprehensible Genibux Strategy Language (GSL) together with Machine Learning and classifying algorithms enclosed in a set of highly interactive interfaces. Most importantly, it performs exceedingly well and depicts more profit gains through Genibux improved trading strategies. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"complex event processing; Data mining; Domain Specific Language; Forex; Graph mining; machine learning"}

Enormous amounts of high-frequency trading data are generated by huge numbers of market participants in every trading day. The availability of this information allows researchers to further examine the statistical properties of informationally efficient market hypothesis (EMH). Heterogenous market hypothesis (HMH) is one of the important extensions of EMH literature. HMH introduced nonlinear trading behaviors of heterogenous market participants instead of normality assumption under the EMH homogenous market participants. In this study, we attempt to explore more high-frequency volatility estimators in the HMH examination. These include the bipower, tripower, and quadpower variation integrated volatility estimates using Heterogenous AutoRegressive (HAR) models. The empirical findings show that these alternatives multipower variation (MPV) estimators provide better estimation and out-of-sample forecast evaluations as compared to the standard realized volatility. In other words, the usage of MPV estimators is able to better explain the HMH statistically.

This decision is influenced by characteristics of the order flows and queue sizes in each limit order book, as well as the structure of transaction fees and rebates across exchanges. We propose a quantitative framework for studying this order placement problem by formulating it as a convex optimization problem. This formulation allows the study of how the optimal order placement decision depends on the interplay between the state of order books, the fee structure, order flow properties and the aversion to execution risk. In the case of a single exchange, we derive an explicit solution for the optimal split between limit and market orders. For the general case of order placement across multiple exchanges, we propose a stochastic algorithm that computes the optimal routing policy and study the sensitivity of the solution to various parameters. Our algorithm does not require an explicit statistical model of order flow but exploits data on recent order fills across exchanges in the numerical implementation of the algorithm to acquire this information through a supervised learning procedure. \u00a9 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Author Keywords":"Algorithmic trading; Execution risk; Limit order markets; Machine learning; Optimal order execution; Order routing; Robbins\u2013Monro algorithm; Stochastic approximation; Supervised learning; Transaction costs"}

First, the parameters of the corresponding Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck (OU) process are estimated by auto-regressive Hidden Markov Models (AR-HMM), in order to capture the underlying characteristics of the financial time series. Portfolio optimization is then performed by maximizing the return achieved with a predefined probability instead of optimizing the predictability parameter, which provides more profitable portfolios. The selection of the optimal portfolio according to the goal function is carried out by stochastic search algorithms. The presented solutions satisfy the cardinality constraint in terms of providing a sparse portfolios which minimize the transaction costs (and, as a result, maximize the interpretability of the results). In order to use the method for high frequency trading (HFT) we utilize a massively parallel GPGPU architecture. Both the portfolio optimization and the model identification algorithms are successfully tailored to be running on GPGPU to meet the challenges of efficient software implementation and fast execution time. The performance of the new method has been extensively tested both on historical daily and intraday FOREX data and on artificially generated data series. The results demonstrate that a good average return can be achieved by the proposed trading algorithm in realistic scenarios.

Surprisingly, money managers find that the market volatility becomes more frequent as more advanced innovations are applied in the financial system. For example, the high-frequency trading may amplify the deviation on U.S. stock market [1], [2]. Therefore, a reliable method to appraise the asset performance is extremely important to portfolio managers, regulators, and individual investors. One alternative approach to achieve this goal is data envelopment analysis (DEA). Asset performance was ranked from both self- and peer-evaluation perspectives. Specifically, we extended the cross-efficiency analysis in DEA that uses row and column means to portfolio selection and identify different types of asset set. This classification process can help investors to construct a more robust portfolio. Numerical experiments based on S&P500 showed that the portfolio with cross-efficiency analysis can generate better Sharpe ratios during the period of financial crisis in 2008. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.","Author Keywords":"Cross-efficiency analysis; data envelopment analysis (DEA); portfolio selection; uncertainty"}

However, these patterns are often elusive as they are affected by many uncertain political-economic factors in the real world, such as corporate performances, government policies, and even breaking news circulated across markets. Moreover, time series of stock prices are non-stationary and non-linear, making the prediction of future price trends much challenging. To address them, we propose a novel State Frequency Memory (SFM) recurrent network to capture the multi-frequency trading patterns from past market data to make long and short term predictions over time. Inspired by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the SFM decomposes the hidden states of memory cells into multiple frequency components, each of which models a particular frequency of latent trading pattern underlying the fluctuation of stock price. Then the future stock prices are predicted as a nonlinear mapping of the combination of these components in an Inverse Fourier Transform (IFT) fashion. Modeling multi-frequency trading patterns can enable more accurate predictions for various time ranges: while a shortterm prediction usually depends on high frequency trading patterns, a long-term prediction should focus more on the low frequency trading patterns targeting at long-term return. Unfortunately, no existing model explicitly distinguishes between various frequencies of trading patterns to make dynamic predictions in literature. The experiments on the real market data also demonstrate more competitive performance by the SFM as compared with the state-of-the-art methods. \u00a9 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Author Keywords":"Multi-frequency trading patterns; State frequency memory; Stock price prediction"}

Constructing direct forecasts in the context of formulating volume weighted average price trading strategies requires the generation of a sequence of multistep-ahead forecasts. I discuss nonlinear transformations to ensure nonnegative forecasts and lag length selection for generating a sequence of direct forecasts. In contrast to the literature based on low-frequency macroeconomic data, I find that direct multiperiod forecasts can outperform iterated forecasts when the conditioning information set is dynamically updated in real time.

Based on these empirical findings, we introduce and calibrate a Markov chain-modulated pure jump model of price, spread, LO and MO arrivals and volume imbalance. As an application of the model, we pose and solve a stochastic control problem for an agent who maximizes terminal wealth, subject to inventory penalties, by executing trades using LOs. We use in-sample-data (January to June 2014) to calibrate the model to 11 equities traded in the Nasdaq exchange and use out-of-sample data (July to December 2014) to test the performance of the strategy.

Betting exchange markets are fairly similar to the financial markets in terms of their operation. Due to the lower market share and newer technology, there are very few tools available for automated trading for betting exchanges. The in-depth analysis of features available in commercial software demonstrates that there is no commercial software that natively supports machine learned strategy development. Furthermore, previously published academic software products are not publicly obtainable. Hence, this work concentrates on developing a full-stack solution from data capture, back-testing to automated Strategy Agent development for betting exchanges. Moreover, work also explores ways to forecast price movements within betting exchange using new machine learned trading strategies based on Artificial Neuron Networks (ANN) and Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). Automatically generated strategies can then be deployed on a server and require no human interaction.

Quantitative trading applies a wide range of computational approaches such as statistics, physics, or machine learning to analyze, predict, and take advantage of big data in finance for investment. This work studies core components of a quantitative trading system. Machine learning offers a number of important advantages over traditional algorithmic trading. With machine learning, multiple trading strategies are implemented consistently and able to adapt to real-time market. To demonstrate how machine learning techniques can meet quantitative trading, linear regression and support vector regression models are used to predict stock movement. In addition, multiple optimization techniques are used to optimize the return and control risk in trading. One common characteristic for both prediction models is they effectively performed in short-term prediction with high accuracy and return. However, in short-term prediction, the linear regression model is outperform compared to the support vector regression model. The prediction accuracy is considerably improved by adding technical indicators to dataset rather than adjusted price and volume.

This method is to calculate the profitability of a trading system, applied to specific past period. The data which are used, correspond to that specific past period and are called \u201chistorical data\u201d or \u201ctraining data\u201d. There is a plethora of trading systems, which include technical indicators, trend following indicators, oscillators, control indicators of price level, etc. It is common nowadays for calculations of technical indicator values to be used along with the prices of securities or shares, as training data in fuzzy, hybrid and support vector machine\/regression (SVM\/SVR) systems. Whether the data are used in fuzzy systems, or for SVM and SVR systems training, the historical data period selection on most occasions is devoid of validation (In this research we designate historical data as training data). We substantiate that such an expert trading system, has a profitability edge\u2014with regard to future transactions\u2014over currently applied trading strategies that merely implement parameters\u2019 optimization. Thus not profitable trading systems can be turned into profitable. To that end, first and foremost, an optimal historical data period must be determined, secondarily a parameters optimization computation must be completed and finally the right conditions of parameters must be applied for optimal parameters\u2019 selection. In this new approach, we develop an integrated dynamic computation algorithm, called the \u201cd-BackTest PS Method\u201d, for selection of optimal historical data period, periodically. In addition, we test conditions of parameters and values via back-testing, using multi agent technology, integrated in an automated trading expert system based on Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) technical indicator. This dynamic computation algorithm can be used in Technical indicators, Fuzzy, SVR and SVM and hybrid forecasting systems. The outcome crystalizes in an autonomous intelligent trading system. \u00a9 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Author Keywords":"Back testing optimization algorithms; d-BackTest PS method; Expert back testing systems; Forex; MACD optimization; Optimal historical data period selection"}

The limitations of traditional portfolio theory are overcome using a multi-period definition of the problem. The model allows the inclusion of dynamic restrictions like transaction costs, portfolio unbalance, and inflation. A Monte Carlo method is proposed to handle these types of restrictions. The investment strategies method is introduced to make trading decisions based on the investor\u2019s preference and the current state of the market. Preference is determined using heuristics instead of theoretical utility functions. The method was tested using real data from the Mexican market. The method was compared against buy-and-holds and single-period portfolios for metrics like the maximum loss, expected return, risk, the Sharpe\u2019s ratio, and others. The results indicate investment strategies perform trading with less risk than other methods. Single-period methods attained the lowest performance in the experiments due to their high transaction costs. The conclusion was investment decisions that are improved when information providing from many different sources is considered. Also, profitable decisions are the result of a careful balance between action (transaction) and inaction (buy-and-hold). \u00a9 2017, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Author Keywords":"Algorithmic trading; Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective; Portfolio optimization"}
